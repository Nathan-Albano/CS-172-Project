            "This is an actual wholesome story. A departure from the usual orphan-crushing-machine stories. It reminds me a bit of that Japanese story about a student being the last train passenger and how they kept it operating so she can finish school.",

            "This really should come back. It genuinely is a missing and integral part of western civilization, at the very least.  \nIt takes so little. There used to be video rentals every couple blocks in most places, and while it became superfluous at the time, it really just had a special place for a lot of people. It could at least be upheld in a few locations as an option for those who are nostalgic for it, or those who never got to experience it.  \nIts no trip to Blockbuster or the like, but it wont ever be unappreciated now that mordernism has taken something so simple away."

            "Have been through chemo twice in my life, both times made sure to exercise before and after the treatments. Long walks the days before and after, not pulling weights etc. Have never had too many side effects. No nausea, nothing.  \nWhen people are diagnosed with cancer, they usually tell me, because having gone through it twice, they consider me an expert. I usually tell them that I cannot help them with advice, because there are hundreds kinds of cancer, all behaving differently, with different symptoms and treatments.  \nAll I say is: I know one thing, the more you've exercised the days before chemo, the less the treatment will impact you.",
            "Maybe it's that people who have enough energy to exercise are experiencing side effects less",

            "My mom went through chemo when I was a teenager, and it's a testament to her ironclad determination and insane motivation that she kept going to the gym almost every day during her treatments. Guess there might be some connection there to her treatment being successful.",
            "As someone who lives with stage IV breast cancer I can say with certainty that this is very very true.  I have been living with cancer for almost 4 years now and was active all through treatment.  I attribute exercise to being able to keep my energy levels up, decrease pain, enhance my appetite, combat insomnia, increase my bone density and most importantly help with anxiety and stress.  I am currently in the best shape of my life and have had zero progression.  I\u2019m so passionate about the science behind this and helping other cancer patients throughout their journey, that I left my engineering career to become an oncology exercise specialist (still in progress).  If any cancer patients are reading this and want resources or information, I\u2019m always willing to chat all things cancer and exercise \ud83d\udcaa\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",
            "I work for a group called BfitBwell cancer exercise program that has been doing just this for about 13 yrs. Located in Colorado, USA. We also collaborate with research. Not everyone in treatment is up for it, and we've seen some incredible things for people coming through our program. \n\nhttps://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/colorado-cancer-center/for-patients-families/supportive-care/bfitbwell-cancer-exercise-program",
            "My ex-husband had cancer before we dated. His dr prescribed him an antidepressant because everyone with cancer needs it. Not him! He was also prescribed steroids, and since he had nothing better to do, he would work out all the time. He ended up *gaining* weight while going through chemotherapy.",
            "Finished treatment 2024.\nExercise helped during chemo ( bi- weekly dose-dense Doxorubicin ) \nSome days I could ride 10kms other days I could manage a very short slow walk . Either way it helped with symptoms especially reconnecting my mind and body which often felt detached .",
            "I worked in cancer rehabilitation as a physical therapist for 6 years and worked with all varieties of patients from those in remission to those with only a day or two left to live.\n\nThis review is thankfully confirming what we already knew about exercising cancer rehab. Logically makes sense, exercise increases blood flow oxygenation to tissues has anti-inflammatory effects through your entire system and also helps maintain lean body muscle mass during chemotherapy. \n\nThe trick to exercise during chemotherapy really comes down to managing the volume and intensity. What I would always tell my patients is that doing something is always going to be good. Unless of course you have specific needs dictating the type of exercise you can do such as bone or brain metastases, or if you're a high fall risk, or have other severe comorbidities.\n\nAs anyone that is going through chemotherapy knows, how you feel changes day-to-day and week to week. On week one of your chemo cycle, you might feel really not too bad and be able to walk and do yoga and go to the gym. On week two. You might feel like absolute ass as your blood counts tank and you struggle just to get around the house. And then week three, you start to feel more like yourself again.\n\nWhen someone is on cancer treatment, the role of personalized exercise programs becomes absolutely critical. Someone who is severely neutropenic and anemic might only be able to do one or two stairs, or walk two laps around their house in a day and that's okay. Every little bit helps."

Also a lot of foods that are touted as healthy I realized were not and were actually making my situation worst and I cut them out. So I'm going to hope that more people are like me and are not being tricked by food companies and are being more educated on the matter. Also, yes, our healthcare system is broken AF, but thanks for the ACA it's only $25 for annual preventive care checkups and blood testing, which is better than before and I pay $1 a month for my insurance.

            "From the article.\n\nIn an unexpected feat of innovation and strength, a Toronto father has set a new world record by pushing a stroller containing his son with his car. The event took place at Downsview Park, where onlookers gathered to witness what initially seemed an unlikely stunt. With meticulous planning and adherence to safety protocols, John Turner, a local engineer, and father of three, attempted and succeeded in covering a distance of 3 kilometers using his vehicle to push a specially designed stroller, setting a new record for the longest distance pushed in such a manner.\n\nThe setup involved a custom-built bracket attached to the front bumper of Turner's car, securely holding the stroller in place. Turner, who is passionate about both engineering and spending time with his children, came up with the idea as a light-hearted challenge after realizing that no such record existed. \u201cIt\u2019s all about creating memories with my son and showing him that with a bit of creativity, you can achieve extraordinary things,\u201d said Turner after completing the feat. His son, safely buckled into the stroller and wearing a helmet, seemed to enjoy the ride, waving enthusiastically to the crowd.\n\nNot only did Turner\u2019s record capture the imagination of those present, but it also highlighted the importance of responsible innovation. While this particular stunt was novel and conducted with strict safety measures, Turner emphasized the importance of never attempting such feats without thorough planning and safety checks. The event was not only a personal success but also sparked discussions about unconventional record attempts, underscoring the idea that world records represent a diverse spectrum of human creativity and capability.",
            "I'll take the kid's hat off her stroller and tip it in your direction, kind sir",
            "John Turner's record will inevitably be defeated by Pierre Trudeau's record.",
            "Ok, while the headline is not nearly as bad as it seems considering what has been posted here, what exactly makes this uplifting news?"

            ">One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.\n\n>In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.\n\n>The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight. Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".\n\n>The findings are published [in the journal PLoS One](https://plos.io/3RSL1bu) and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat. The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.\n\n>But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.  \"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.\n\n>It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.\n\n>\"If we can restore this \\[wetland\\] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"\n\nThere are very few axolotl left, and extinction seemed to be a strong possibility. But with human support and a little luck, the axolotl can make a comeback. And who can resist that smile?",

Long walks the days before and after, not pulling weights etc. Have never had too many side effects. No nausea, nothing.  \nWhen people are diagnosed with cancer, they usually tell me, because having gone through it twice, they consider me an expert. I usually tell them that I cannot help them with advice, because there are hundreds kinds of cancer, all behaving differently, with different symptoms and treatments.  \nAll I say is: I know one thing, the more you've exercised the days before chemo, the less the treatment will impact you.",

            "As someone who lives with stage IV breast cancer I can say with certainty that this is very very true.  I have been living with cancer for almost 4 years now and was active all through treatment.  I attribute exercise to being able to keep my energy levels up, decrease pain, enhance my appetite, combat insomnia, increase my bone density and most importantly help with anxiety and stress.  I am currently in the best shape of my life and have had zero progression.  I\u2019m so passionate about the science behind this and helping other cancer patients throughout their journey, that I left my engineering career to become an oncology exercise specialist (still in progress).  If any cancer patients are reading this and want resources or information, I\u2019m always willing to chat all things cancer and exercise \ud83d\udcaa\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

Not everyone in treatment is up for it, and we've seen some incredible things for people coming through our program. \n\nhttps://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/colorado-cancer-center/for-patients-families/supportive-care/bfitbwell-cancer-exercise-program",

He was also prescribed steroids, and since he had nothing better to do, he would work out all the time. He ended up *gaining* weight while going through chemotherapy.",
            "Finished treatment 2024.\nExercise helped during chemo ( bi- weekly dose-dense Doxorubicin ) \nSome days I could ride 10kms other days I could manage a very short slow walk . Either way it helped with symptoms especially reconnecting my mind and body which often felt detached .",
            "I worked in cancer rehabilitation as a physical therapist for 6 years and worked with all varieties of patients from those in remission to those with only a day or two left to live.\n\nThis review is thankfully confirming what we already knew about exercising cancer rehab. Logically makes sense, exercise increases blood flow oxygenation to tissues has anti-inflammatory effects through your entire system and also helps maintain lean body muscle mass during chemotherapy. \n\nThe trick to exercise during chemotherapy really comes down to managing the volume and intensity. What I would always tell my patients is that doing something is always going to be good. Unless of course you have specific needs dictating the type of exercise you can do such as bone or brain metastases, or if you're a high fall risk, or have other severe comorbidities.\n\nAs anyone that is going through chemotherapy knows, how you feel changes day-to-day and week to week. On week one of your chemo cycle, you might feel really not too bad and be able to walk and do yoga and go to the gym. On week two. You might feel like absolute ass as your blood counts tank and you struggle just to get around the house. And then week three, you start to feel more like yourself again.\n\nWhen someone is on cancer treatment, the role of personalized exercise programs becomes absolutely critical. Someone who is severely neutropenic and anemic might only be able to do one or two stairs, or walk two laps around their house in a day and that's okay. Every little bit helps."

            "From the article.\n\nIn an unexpected feat of innovation and strength, a Toronto father has set a new world record by pushing a stroller containing his son with his car. The event took place at Downsview Park, where onlookers gathered to witness what initially seemed an unlikely stunt. With meticulous planning and adherence to safety protocols, John Turner, a local engineer, and father of three, attempted and succeeded in covering a distance of 3 kilometers using his vehicle to push a specially designed stroller, setting a new record for the longest distance pushed in such a manner.\n\nThe setup involved a custom-built bracket attached to the front bumper of Turner's car, securely holding the stroller in place. Turner, who is passionate about both engineering and spending time with his children, came up with the idea as a light-hearted challenge after realizing that no such record existed. \u201cIt\u2019s all about creating memories with my son and showing him that with a bit of creativity, you can achieve extraordinary things,\u201d said Turner after completing the feat. His son, safely buckled into the stroller and wearing a helmet, seemed to enjoy the ride, waving enthusiastically to the crowd.\n\nNot only did Turner\u2019s record capture the imagination of those present, but it also highlighted the importance of responsible innovation. While this particular stunt was novel and conducted with strict safety measures, Turner emphasized the importance of never attempting such feats without thorough planning and safety checks. The event was not only a personal success but also sparked discussions about unconventional record attempts, underscoring the idea that world records represent a diverse spectrum of human creativity and capability.",

            "John Turner's record will inevitably be defeated by Pierre Trudeau's record.",

            ">One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.\n\n>In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.\n\n>The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight. Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".\n\n>The findings are published [in the journal PLoS One](https://plos.io/3RSL1bu) and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat. The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.\n\n>But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.  \"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.\n\n>It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.\n\n>\"If we can restore this \\[wetland\\] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"\n\nThere are very few axolotl left, and extinction seemed to be a strong possibility. But with human support and a little luck, the axolotl can make a comeback. And who can resist that smile?",

By embracing robotics, China aims to enhance export competitiveness in the face of mounting trade barriers.\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1kbp1ot/china_relies_on_robots_to_offset_tariffs_a/mpw5sxk/",
            "This is the nightmare scenario for the tariffs. \n\nObviously they are kind of stupid to begin with, but the intent is to bring manufacturing back to the US, right?\n\nWhat if in the end, it pushes China to be even *cheaper* than ever to survive, and even with tariffs the US can't compete?  \n\nIf the US can't compete with the cheap labor costs in China and need tariffs to offset that, what will they do when labor gets even *cheaper* because it's all robots working 24/7?",
            "WTF? China has been automating like crazy since well before Trump's Tariffs ever showed up, so no robots have nothing to do with offsetting tariffs.  That's just dumb.\n\nChina's pricing mechanism is based on value for the money and intense competition. For example consider BYD's Seagull which was originally priced at $10,200. A year later it was priced at $9,700 when BYD passed on some of its falling costs of production, basically a 5% price reduction.  This year the price is down to about $8,000 and BYD is also tossing in basic ADAS systems.\n\nIn competitive systems nobody has superfat margins. BYD has good margins with zero US sales. China does not need US sales and they don't have to eat tariffs which is why they introduced matching US tariffs instead of begging for mercy. They haven't even called Trump despite Trump lying about even that.\n\nThe reason that China doesn't need the US market is because they are busy taking over both US and EU export markets. Western car sales are crashing in China, and China's increasing EV exports are driving US/EU car exports into the ground at an accelerating pace. China eventually wants to make 30 million EVs for its domestic market and match that number for the export market. That's 60 million EVs for the export market, current global new car sales are about 90 million per year. China reaches that target in 2028/2029 given its current 40% NEV growth rate.\n\nThat's cars. Take a look at batteries, this bit is from a google search, the first result is from  the AI Overview: \"In the global EV battery market, China's market share is substantial, with CATL leading the way with approximately 38% in 2024. Following close behind is BYD, another Chinese company, holding around 17% of the market. China's dominance extends to key EV battery components, with market shares often exceeding 80% for cathodes, anodes, separators, and electrolytes.\" Pay attention! CATL and BYD have 55% of the battery market and China controls 80%, or better!, of the battery assembly industry's inputs? \n\nTesla's Megapack cells are LFP prismatic from CATL(?) not 4680's or anything of its own making. So this is a lock on the EV and BESS markets.\n\nOn the AI front: DeepSeek is free to download and use. You also get the sourcode so you can make sure it doesn't 'phone home'. So no unicorn profits for the US AI industry.\n\nOn the robotics front: Tesla's actor-in-a-bot-suit humanoid robot, Optimus << Prime (Sub, Sub Prime?), are predicted to have an eventual price of $30K. ETA at that price? the week after the $20K Tesla EV...BYD is also doing the humanoid robot thing, $10K per copy avaiable by the end of this decade. I'm thinking a French maid's uniform for mine...yeah, I mean no unicorn profits for the US bot boys.\n\nChina is not stressing over this Trump Tariffs Thing, it is using this episode of US pissing off its friends and allies, to take over US market share.  It takes years for countries to build factories, industries, and supply chains and US store shelves won't stay stocked if the tariffs don't go away. And China keeps expanding...\n\nSo is the article pure propaganda? Wishful thinking?",
            "Nobody in China thought that in 2025 they will need automation. They actually started in 10 years back. There are even govt incentives for automating and digitizing the factories. Where do you think most of the light-out Industry 4.0 factories are situated? It's not even a race right now. They are winners, by a huge margin.",
            "Can anyone tell me who buys the products if no one has a job?",
            "We're witnessing the decline of unskilled labor. While some industries will still provide purchasing power, there will be far fewer jobs for those just entering the workforce or those without specialized skills. This shift risks making poor communities even poorer. We need programs that offer accessible pathways to learn practical trades and adapt to the changing economy. As long as maximum profits is the motivator it would be difficult to impossible to stop automation with AI robotics.",
            "Manufacturing is never coming back to US, trump should have strengthened our trade with western democracies and made sure manufacturing left china and went to those countries. China has FIVE times the population of America, they graduate 10x the amount of engineers a year than we do. We arent staying the superpower in the 21st century on our own",

So when a satelite breaks down, is attacked, or you just need another one on short notice, you can activate it from the orbital shed and deploy it.\n\n\nIts really not that fancy, and not even inherently Weaponized. It's a basic concept of delivering satellites in bulk delivery to an orbiting warehouse, and then deploying them from there as needed\n\nIts Logistics, not an orbital strike platform with bombers or some nonsense\n\nLong term it might be used to replenish and support orbital anti missile satellites, but the near term it's just a shed full of backup communications and reconnaissance sats.\n\nIt could reasonably Save money, as a single heavy launch delivering a warehouse to orbit can be more affordable than sending lots of frequent short notice rockets from earth. Once again, basic logistics, its generally speaking cheaper to deliver in bulk to a local distribution point like a store or warehouse, then distribute from there as needed, than to do delivery on demand all the way from the source. \n\nThis concept also has benefits for commercial and civilian government satellites like communications constellations and weather/research constellations. Backup satellites kept packaged and powered down on an orbital warehouse could be quicker and cheaper deployed to replace failed satellites in the even of system failures, or disasters like solar storms.\n\nWith a bit more advancement you could use the warehouse systems that unpack age the stored satellites, to outfit them for specific missions. A common universal satellite bus, and a stock of modules for power, comms, sensors that are attached as needed. Deliver bulk packages of satelite chassis and modules to warehouse, they outfit activate and launch satelite from warehouse on demand.",

            "From the article. \n\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Feinberg Lab have made a major breakthrough using their novel Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) 3D bioprinting technique. This method enables the precise printing of soft, living cells and tissues. Leveraging this technology, the team successfully created the first-ever microphysiologic system, also known as a tissue model, constructed entirely from collagen. This advancement opens new possibilities for studying disease and engineering tissue therapies, including potential treatments for conditions like Type 1 diabetes.\n\nTraditionally, small-scale models of human tissue, referred to as microfluidics, organ-on-chip devices, or microphysiologic systems, have been fabricated using synthetic materials such as silicone rubber or plastics. These materials were necessary due to limitations in earlier manufacturing techniques. However, because they are not biologically native, they fail to fully replicate natural tissue environments, restricting their effectiveness in biomedical research and therapeutic development.\n\n\u201cNow, we can build microfluidic systems in the Petri dish entirely out of collagen, cells, and other proteins, with unprecedented structural resolution and fidelity,\u201d explained Adam Feinberg, a professor of biomedical engineering and materials science & engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cMost importantly, these models are fully biologic, which means cells function better.\u201d\n\nBuilding Complex Tissues with FRESH Bioprinting\nIn new research published in Science Advances, the group demonstrates the use of this FRESH bioprinting advancement, building more complex vascularized tissues out of fully biologic materials, to create a pancreatic-like tissue that could potentially be used in the future to treat Type 1 diabetes. This advancement in FRESH bioprinting builds on the team\u2019s earlier work published in Science, by improving the resolution and quality to create fluidic channels that are like blood vessels down to about 100-micron diameter.\n\nDOI:\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav9051",
            "This kind of research is important and one day could prove crucial to curing type 1 diabetes. But right now it's useless. Until we're able to stop the autoimmune response that causes the destruction of the beta cells in the first place, this isn't going to help. \n\nThis is not a cure or even the hope of one. It's only one part of a cure and we already have quite a few other promising techniques for this part of it.",
            "The article doesn't say anything about the immune system.  \n\nI can only assume the underlying cause for many cases of diabetes, namely the body's immune system attacking the islet cells, remains unchanged.  The patient will likely need to stay on immunosuppressants forever.",

Same way as people 100 years ago didn\u2019t need internet, computers, mobile phones, even cars, AC, dishwasher, fridge, good house insulation etc. - they thought if they have roof over your head, source of heat, enough food (of local variety), maybe a bike, warm clothes, you were seen as leading a good life. Now it\u2019s seen as struggling.",
            "Profit margins shrink but the volume skyrockets and other uses for the technology become apparent.   People will still invest money into a safe bet if it gets them some small margin.  If there was a technology that had this amazing ability, it would have a market of 8 billion people.  Even if it only profits one dollar per day per person, such a technology would serve all eight billion of us and would still make trillions in profits annually.  Look at the tech industry.  Compared to the 80s-2000s, computers and phones are super cheap and are incredibly powerful.   The cheap computer you could get today for $400 is more powerful than a $40,000 computer in 2005.  But this cheap era of computers results in far more sales. \n\nThe company makes the lab meats, which I also think will be a thing and my fanciful prediction is that it will make food 10x cheaper than today\u2019s prices. So it\u2019s not free, but it could be like less than a dollar per pound.  Not that this is rhe realistic expectation but more or less where I think the absolute best case scenario and how much that would change society.  There would be other value adds such as having a robot cook your meal and then deliver it to your home.  Likewise they might also use this technology to make other materials that today\u2019s food producers are not.  Things like silk production and even compounds that have not been discovered yet. \n\nIf construction robots make construction way cheaper,  like the cost is 10 times cheaper than human labor, what we will probably see is much grander projects,  I love the idea of the arcologies as conceived by Paolo Soleri, I recommend everyone read that book.  But these things cannot be build with today\u2019s human labor.  If we had brews of millions of humanoid worker robots the scale of the projects we can do as a species goes up dramatically.  Let\u2019s build arcologies, let\u2019s build hyoerloops, high speed rails,  horse trails, parks, everything.   If construction labor drops to a few dollars per hour per robot the scale of our projects will get far bigger. We can do 100 times as much stuff as we are doing now. \n\nThe overwhelming vast majority of the global mega projects that will exist in 2100 do not exist yet.  The tech doesn\u2019t devalue itself,  the scale of the tech explodes. A precision fermentation industry that can handle the needs of 8 billion humans and our pets is still going to be a several trillion dollar per year industry.  We we are going to have several billion worker robots building our dreams, even if the margin is tiny for the Robot companies it will still be an enormous industry,",

            "Not without a significant change in capitalism.\n\nIn the U.S. there are many markets driven by artificial scarcity.\n\nAbundance is the enemy of capitalism. Scarcity drives profits, and successful corporations will always seek to control markets.",
            "First off, remember that these two inventions would initially be patented, so competition wouldn't cut prices down. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the inventors went the Salk route, prioritizing widespread availability over their own profit, that would get a situation more like what you've described. Then, companies would start popping up all over to make and sell these new foods. \n\nLet's say it costs something ridiculously low for the producer, like $0.50 for enough food for a person for a week. The first company pops up in an area where the average low-income individual spends $100/week on food. Knowing that these meals would be less appealing, at least initially, than traditional food, the company decides to try for around $30 for a week worth of food. Thus, one meal costs the distributor $1.50. The distributor tacks on another $0.10, making it $1.60 per meal for the consumer. The producer is therefore getting a 200% margin - huge profits. \n\nThen another 4 producers all pop up in the same area, willing to make only a 100% margin. The first producer must match that to compete, and the cost to the consumer per meal is now $1.10. This keeps going down until the cost is barely above the $0.60 bare minimum required to break even - remember that the distributor gets their $0.10 cut. \n\nAt this point, the meals are no longer a money printer. They can keep the company running, but they don't generate a lot of profit for investors or enable any growth for the company. However, they are a secure investment. Investors who want long-term security and are okay with low annual returns will still provide enough investment for slow, but steady growth. Seeing the potential to relieve hunger, governments and charities will invest in these meals, setting up factories all over the world. \n\nThis is where the cracks start to show, though. Once a bunch of companies are selling the same thing at all the same price, the only way to make more profit is to lie, cheat, and steal. First, they'll do the legal stuff. They'll advertise. They'll put bright colors and flavorful additives in/on the product. They'll get famous promoters. They'll reshape the container to look bigger than it is. And they'll drop the quality of the product and the wages of their factory workers. Next, they'll cut corners illegally. They'll ignore regulations. Dump runoff in streams. Bulk out the product with cheaper filler. Mix in addictive additives. Promote false health benefits. And so on. And eventually, they'll start forming cartels. And they'll find sneaky ways to get away with all of this. All the while, they'll keep the product profitable. Often very profitable. \n\nAlso remember that cheaper food means cheaper cost of living. Taxes drop when food assistance welfare becomes cheaper. Wages drop when workers can survive on less. The costs to employers in every industry drop with wages. And while some of these price drops will be passed on to consumers, much of them will stay with the companies and their owners.",
            "There isn\u2019t anyone anywhere trying to find a cheap, efficient method of manufacturing anything so that they can sell it for cheap. They want to make it cheaper and sell it for slightly less than their competitors. If someone could make a completely nutritious 2,000 calorie shake for less than a dollar they would sell it for slightly less than whatever it normally costs on average to feed a person per day. Assuming their competitors keep doing what they are doing and stay in business nothing would change. I think tech solves for efficiency on accident. It\u2019s a byproduct in the process of trying to create a new market. \n\nEveryone already knows about assembly lines and robotics and quality control efficiencies that are going to be incorporated into the next generation of any given factory. Any efficiency gained can be laid squarely at the feet of trying to reduce the bottom line to increase profits. Technological innovation in and of itself gets no credit. I\u2019m arguing that efficiency gains are a byproduct of business practices and are going to rise over time in step with technological advancement as a matter of course. \n\nThe owners of the world\u2019s wealth are going to continue to see the world from a perspective of scarcity until there is a new shift in social progress. \nTake for example, Weatherbug. It\u2019s an app that uses publicly, freely available satellite data to tell you what the weather is like. The owners of weatherbug have been lobbying to get the free publicly available NOAA data removed from public access so that they can gate keep the data and force consumers to use their applications to get weather information.\n\nA business came along and found a way to turn a profit off of free abundant information paid for by tax dollars. Naturally they want to be the only people that have that resource so they can charge more for it. They want to make it scarce to raise its value. This is what business do. They will do it in the future too if we don\u2019t all get together and change the way we think about goods and services and ownership. \n\nIf you invented a tile that could power a home for a month after only one days exposure to sunlight you would totally change world forever. If you sold it for a dollar a tile you would crash the world\u2019s economy over night. In the aftermath I think we would end up with a world that works different than it used to. Truly cheap access to efficient, green off grid power would end up remaking society. If you sold it for $100,000 a tile the world would inevitably change but it would keep working the same way.",
            "None of this is going to happen. You cannot synthesize nutrition. You can grow things in a different fashion, but homogenization will either result in degraded health and outcomes or certain nutrients that have to be introduced into the process will become disproportionately expensive.\n\nLikely those elements will be just left out of the shakes for \u201cthe poors,\u201d leading to horrific outcomes."

The only place they were allowed to buy land was an area which was very low and had soil which made it basically impossible to dig sanitation infrastructure. \n\nOn top of that, due to segregationist zoning laws and redlining, their parents and grandparents were prohibited from buying land elsewhere. \n\nNow, they cannot move because the land they live on is basically worthless - nobody would want to buy their property for a reasonable price - and they cannot climb out of poverty due to suppressed wages and higher medical bills - due to the lack of sanitation.\n\nCan't sell the land, can't get better wages, can't climb out of poverty. \n\nThis is true for all the people there, regardless of race.\n\nSo, to repeat myself: the *current program* has nothing to do with DEI and race.

            "We non-poisoners are extremely lucky that science has finally evolved to where poisons can be generally identified and traced post-mortem. It's extremely hard to get away with poisoning in modern societies now. Including from mushrooms. But in other societies, it's still rampant.\n\nI'm most familiar with it in the pan-African context, but I presume it's common worldwide, until the science catches up. Poisoning was a common event in my best friend/collaborator's life in the Samburu tribe (a Maasai subgroup) in rural Kenya, and features prominently in the story of her childhood we did. I've seen it repeatedly in other African novels and memoirs as well, off the top of my head Adichie's \"Purple Hibiscus\" (Nigeria, west Africa) and Trevor Noah's \"Born a Crime\" (South Africa).\n\nWe're honestly very, very fortunate that the threat of actually being caught is becoming a true deterrence. Even this lady had to \"cook up\" some excuse as to why she had poison mushrooms in the dish: she realized she might be traced.",

            "> A 27-year-old U.S. Marine in Japan's Okinawa Prefecture was indicted on Wednesday for allegedly raping a woman and injuring another in a U.S. military base restroom last month, according to local prosecutors.\n\n> Austin Wedington, who was under custody by the U.S. military in line with the bilateral Status of Forces Agreement, was handed over to Japanese authorities the same day. The accord governs the legal status and conduct of U.S. military personnel in Japan.\n\n> The prosecutors have not disclosed Wedington's response to the allegations. The assault allegedly occurred in the central part of the main island of Okinawa.\n\n> Multiple sexual violence cases by U.S. service members in Okinawa have come to light since June last year, leading to four indictments to date. The southern island prefecture hosts the bulk of U.S. military facilities in Japan.\n\n> \"There have been ongoing sexual assaults by U.S. military personnel despite our call for swift preventative measures,\" said Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki.\n\n> \"We cannot help but have doubts regarding the education and management of U.S. military personnel. We strongly urge the implementation of more effective countermeasures,\" he added.\n\n> According to the indictment, Wedington choked a female civilian worker in a base lavatory before sexually assaulting her against a stall door and then stomped on the face of the woman who tried to rescue her.\n\n> Okinawa police voluntarily questioned Wedington after receiving a report. His case was referred to prosecutors on April 7.\n\n> U.S. Ambassador to Japan George Glass said in a statement that he was \"disturbed\" by the allegations, adding that it does not \"reflect the values of the tens of thousands of U.S. servicemembers who serve here honorably.\"\n\n> The indictment comes as the U.S. forces and the Japanese government prepare to hold the first meeting of a forum on May 9 to \"address a range of issues and improve community relations.\"\n\n> The forum had been created to strengthen cooperation among the U.S. military, the central Japanese government and Okinawa's government and local residents as part of efforts to prevent sexual crimes involving American military personnel.\n\n> Revelations last year by media that the central government had failed to disclose alleged sexual assault cases involving U.S. military members angered locals.",

AB was created wholesale out of what was formerly known as Rupert's Land, which was owned by the Hudson Bay company and surrendered to the government of Canada. AB was then created from that federally administered territory by the Canadian government. To change this would require changing the Articles of Confederation, and that requires iirc, the premieres of 7 provinces to agree to it, and a general vote of 50% in Canada.\n\nThat's not even getting into the fact that all of AB is covered by treaty 6, 7, and 8 with the indigenous peoples.

            "# San Mateo County expands mobile mental health response\n\nRyan Macasero\\~4 minutes\n\nSan Mateo County will expand its 24/7 mobile mental health crisis response service this May, offering an alternative for residents who might be hesitant to seek help due to potential police involvement in mental health situations.\n\nResidents can call the San Mateo County Crisis Line at 650-579-0350 or 988 for free help for themselves, family members or friends. Dispatchers will screen calls to determine the appropriate response, coordinating with 911 and emergency services if necessary. The service will be available to residents of all ages living anywhere in the county.\n\nThe county chose to launch its outreach campaign in May to coincide with Mental Health Awareness Month, aiming to raise awareness of the service and how to access it.\n\nWhile the service is not a replacement for 911 in life-threatening emergencies, the county emphasized that many calls made to emergency services related to mental health crises may not necessarily require a police response.\n\n\u201cThis service provides an alternative to traditional law enforcement response,\u201d the county said in a statement. \u201cMany county leaders, along with advocates for those with mental illness, have advocated for an approach to responding to those in a mental or behavioral health crisis without law enforcement\u2019s involvement.\u201d\n\nResponders will arrive in unmarked vehicles \u2014 without lights or sirens \u2014 and will be available around the clock, every day of the year, the county said. Their goal will be to stabilize situations and, if needed, transport individuals to facilities or help determine and arrange the appropriate level of care.\n\nMobile team members are required to undergo extensive state-mandated training to ensure they are prepared to handle a wide range of crisis situations.\n\nFollow-up support will be provided 24 hours after the first call, and county behavioral health services will help facilitate short- and long-term treatment plans aimed at preventing future crises.\n\nSimilar mobile mental health crisis response teams already exist in other parts of the Bay Area, including San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose.\n\n[San Jose previously](https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/11/south-bay-proposal-would-create-direct-line-for-non-police-mental-health-response/) faced scrutiny over its handling of mental health incidents after a 2023 investigation by the Bay Area News Group, KQED and the California Reporting Project found that individuals experiencing mental health issues were involved in almost three out of four of the San Jose Police Department\u2019s use-of-force incidents reported, including 80% of fatal encounters, over a decade.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure it\u2019s clear that no matter when or where in the county you are dealing with a behavioral health crisis, there is appropriate support available, and it can come to you when you need it most,\u201d said Dr. Jei Africa, director of Behavioral Health and Recovery Services.\n\nA pilot program in San Mateo County ran from May 2024 through March. During that period, the mobile crisis team was deployed 320 times and served 220 clients. Response times were recorded at around 60 minutes in central county areas and within 90 minutes on the coast.\n\nFollowing the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors\u2019 approval of nearly $5 million last year, the program is structured with local nonprofit StarVista operating the call center and Telecare Corp. providing mental health clinicians.\n\nTelecare has provided similar mobile crisis services in San Diego County since 2021.\n\nOriginally Published: April 28, 2025 at 12:30 PM [PDTeastbaytimes.com](http://PDTeastbaytimes.com)"

            ">He doesn\u2019t live in a sewer, his name isn\u2019t Donatello and he doesn\u2019t ride a skateboard. But little Root the turtle does get around on his own set of wheels. The wood turtle came to live at the Museum of Natural History in Halifax last September. Unlike most turtles, Root is missing his right front foot.\n\n>Heather McKinnon Ramshaw, the museum\u2019s animal care specialist, says she doesn\u2019t know how he lost the foot, but he\u2019s been that way for a long time. She says he was originally collected from the wild by Natural Resources Department personnel and brought into captivity 20 years ago \u2014 possibly because of his missing foot.\n\n>Root spends most of his time in his enclosure, which is filled with wood chips and has a container of water that he can swim around in. But three times a week, staff at the museum take him out on a little stroll. Early on, they noticed that as Root was tootling around, he was scraping his plastron, or bottom shell, on the floor.\n\n>\u201cBecause one leg is essentially shorter than the other one, we found that he was kind of clunking his shell down,\u201d McKinnon says. \u201cThere was some wear on the shell and we didn\u2019t want it to get worse, so he needed something to lift him up.\u201d\n\n>Enter Tessa Biesterfeld, a naturalist interpreter at the museum. The museum had a Lego exhibit in December, and Biesterfeld had the idea to create a platform with wheels out of Lego pieces to lift Root up higher so his shell wouldn\u2019t get damaged.\n\n>The first incarnation used medical adhesive tape and a bandage to attach some wheels, but staff didn\u2019t want to have to stick something to his shell every time he went out for his constitutional. So Biesterfeld came up with the idea of using a removable dog harness along with the Lego platform and wheels.\n\n>\u201cWe thought that\u2019d be so great because we know it\u2019s non-toxic, we know that we can replace the parts as we need, and should his shell change or grow, we can change the shape and size of that. It\u2019s very modular,\u201d says Biesterfeld.\n\n>The first day, Root had an unexpectedly speedy slide down a ramp, but quickly became accustomed to using the contraption. \u201cNow when I snap his harness on, it\u2019s like when he hears that snap, he\u2019s ready to go,\u201d says Biesterfeld.\n\n>With the help of his wheels, Root enjoys exploring different areas of the museum, and may even have a leg up on other members of his species.\n\nA bit of innovation using simple Lego pieces and Root was good to go.",

            "As a Calgarian, a slight context to why we removed fluoride.  When it was removed, the issue wasn't in a vacuum. The equipment needed to add fluoride was end of life and needed to be replaced by the city at the cost of millions of dollars. Not much by the cities budget, but an initiative for the replacement got enough signatures on a petition to get it added to the upcoming election as a plebiscite issue. 50%+ people voted to remove it during that election with the typical anti fluoride propaganda.\n\nA solid 10+ years later, once the data started coming in about the uptick in cavities, another plebiscite was added to our last municipal election, and adding fluoride back passed. And that's where we are.\n\n**EDIT: slight correction, I Mandela effected the plebiscite in 2011, it was actually a city council vote only that decided to remove fluoride.  However we have historically had lots of plebiscites and debate and votes on fluoride, including one to re-introduce it.**\n\n * https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-removing-fluoride-from-water-supply-1.1022279\n * https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/a-brief-history-of-calgarys-long-relationship-with-fluoride-votes",

            "I feel the clipped statement is lacking since it leaves out the control group. The study looked at Calgary, which removed fluoride, and Edmonton, which did not and serves as a control. Without the Edmonton data, the Calgary data is worthless. The full quote:\n\n\u201cIn Calgary, the team surveyed 2,649 second-graders around seven years after fluoridation ended, meaning they had likely never been exposed to fluoride in their drinking water. Of those, 65 percent had tooth decay. In Edmonton, 55 percent of surveyed children had tooth decay. While those percentages may seem close, they mark a statistically significant difference that McLaren calls \u201cquite large\u201d on the population level.\u201d\n\nThe results above are simply binary. Tooth decay; yes or no? But there\u2019s also data which quantified, roughly, how much worse the health outcomes were for the two:\n\n\u201cIn 2024, another study found a higher rate of tooth decay-related treatments for which a child was placed under general anesthesia in Calgary than in Edmonton. From 2018 to 2019, 32 out of every 10,000 children in Calgary were put under general anesthesia to treat tooth decay, compared with 17 for every 10,000 children in Edmonton.\u201d\n\nEssentially, while I would disagree with the authors and say the binary metric shows only a moderate, as opposed to \u2018quite large,\u2019 increase in incidence of tooth decay, the degree of the decay in the Calgary group seems far worse. Almost double the rate of surgical intervention. That\u2019s a lot of money, pain, and trouble for no real reason. Which is why Calgary \u201cvoted in 2021 to bring [fluoride] back. With 62 percent of voters opting to reintroduce fluoride, the margin was higher than it was in the 1989 vote that brought fluoride to Calgary in the first place.\u201d",

            "Tooth enamel is primarily formed from hydroxyapatite, a form of calcium phosphate. Hydroxyapatite forms a crystalline lattice that gives teeth strength. The problem with a crystalline lattice is that it can be very brittle when forces are applied along one of the axes of symmetry. When a crystal breaks, the fracture typically traverses through the entire plane of subunit interfaces, resulting in a catastrophic failure that\u00a0splits the crystal in two.\n\n\nFluoride can be incorporated into teeth as fluorapatite, a compound very similar to hydroxyapatite, but with a slightly different shape. This causes the crystalline lattice in our teeth to \"bend\" a bit where fluorapatite is incorporated. When a fault in the crystal reaches this imperfection it terminates, preventing catastrophic failure of the entire crystal. This gives teeth better toughness and wear resistance compared to hydroxyapatite alone.\n\n\nFurther, fluorapatite is more resistant to acidic conditions, which can dissolve hydroxyapatite. Bacteria generate acids when metabolizing carbohydrates, like sugars. The presence of fluorapatite in the tooth enamel helps slow acid-driven erosion.",

This is a particular construction of a cosmological scenario using concepts in string theory. This construction makes certain predictions that are consistent with the recent observational hint of a dark energy that changes strength over time. Many other theoretical proposals, string theory or not, have done the same. To tell them apart, you have to make additional predictions about things that haven\u2019t been observed yet, and then observe them.

This twist creates a unique pattern, leading to unusual behaviors in electrons. Scientists have discovered that in these \u201ctwisted\u201d materials, electrons can organize themselves in unexpected ways, forming new states of matter that don\u2019t exist in untwisted materials.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\u26a1 The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nOne of these new states is called the \u201cfractional quantum Hall effect.\u201d In this state, electrons behave as if they have a fraction of their usual electric charge. This phenomenon was observed in materials made by stacking two layers of molybdenum ditelluride with a slight twist. Using a technique called microwave impedance microscopy, researchers visualized this effect, seeing that the interior of the material doesn\u2019t conduct electricity, while the edges allow electrons to flow freely.  \ufffc \ufffc\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Why This Matters\n\nThese discoveries are exciting because they reveal new ways that electrons can behave, which could lead to advances in quantum computing.

            "I asked ChatGPT to ELI 8th grader.  It actually really helped me:\n\nA new idea says that gravity \u2014 the force that keeps us on the ground and makes planets orbit the sun \u2014 might actually come from entropy, which is a fancy word for how much disorder or information there is in a system.\n\nAt the center of this idea is something called quantum relative entropy. Think of it like this:\nImagine you have two different video games, and you want to measure how similar or different their rules are. Quantum relative entropy is a tool that compares how much information one game has compared to the other.\n\nThe scientist, Bianconi, says that the shape of space and time \u2014 what we call spacetime \u2014 is actually like a special kind of quantum \u201cprogram\u201d that holds information. She suggests that gravity happens because there\u2019s a difference between two things:\n\n- The normal shape of space,\n- And the shape that\u2019s changed by the stuff (matter) that\u2019s inside it.\n\nThis builds on an old idea from physicist John Wheeler, who said:\n\n\u201cMatter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter how to move.\u201d\n\nBut Bianconi goes further, trying to describe that in the language of information theory and statistics (how likely certain things are).\n\nBecause black holes are closely connected to entropy (they behave like super massive \u201cstorage spaces\u201d for information), this new idea might also help answer big mysteries \u2014 like whether information that falls into a black hole is lost forever when the black hole disappears.\n\nIn Bianconi\u2019s math, the way black holes store information matches known laws (like how their surface area is tied to their entropy), which is a good sign that her idea might be right."

I mean that's a big problem they're having in the UK right now people are getting arrested for Facebook posts that really aren't hate speech. I mean if you're calling for violence against the lgbtq community than obviously that's hate speech but other than that you should be able to say whatever the fuck you want about anything. Free speech is fundamental to liberty and democracy. It expressly protects unpopular speech. There would have been no civil rights movement in the United States without the First Amendment there would have been no gay rights movement without the First Amendment both of those things at their time were considered unpopular speech. I guess you got to watch out for the word police now",
            "Australia has been on a crusade against hate speech, but it's important to know where it started.\n\n\"Grass root\" groups against hate speech have been around in Australia that have been heavily influnced by Bejing. Edit: [here is a link to an article that better demonstrates the point than the first link i posted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/opinion/beijing-chinese-australians-censorship.html)\n  \n  [Also this one](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/lines-blurred-chinese-community-organisations-australia)\n\nAustralia has Chinese bribes and politics [breaching into their political sphere.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/chinese-australian-billionaire-involved-in-un-bribery-case-mp-claims). Chinese billionaires with close ties to the CCP have been investing in Austraillain [buissness and politics](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/09/chinese-billionaire-met-with-australias-peter-dutton-report.html)\n\nAs well as China increasing its control of crucial resources inside of Australia, including [water rights](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/31/foreign-ownership-of-australias-water-rights-on-the-rise)\n\nI personally do not see this as good news. Even though in the short term LGBQT+ may have protections, China has been trying for years to uproot the liberal democracy of Australia. Censoring speech leagally is the first step",

PP's campaign of negativity and misinformation lost him both the election and his own seat. \n\nMany people were tired of Trudeau, and Poilievre rode that wave for all it was worth. Trudeau resigned and threw a wrench in PP's 'Verb the Noun/I'm not Trudeau' campaign plans. Along came Carney who has experience, people skills, and the ability to answer questions that PP will never have. That and his Trumpian mimicry led to his (hopefully) political downfall.",

            "> Known locally as hargila, the threatened Greater Adjutant stork has found a champion in an unlikely place: the Harglia Army, a group of about 20,000 rural women in India turned conservationists. Since 2014, the women have worked tirelessly to give the storks a desperately needed reputational revamp.  Once reviled as filthy, adjutants prey on fish, frogs, snakes, rats, and smaller birds like ducks, rummaging through landfills looking for carcasses (hargila translates to bone swallower). Its feeding habits cemented its reputation as unsanitary, a perception that led to a rapid population decline of the adjutant, one of the world\u2019s largest and rarest storks. Native to India's floodplains in Assam and Bihar, in 2023, it was recently listed as \u201cnear threatened\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Though its population remains fragile, it is increasing.",

            ">A young boy found Rockalina, a wild eastern box turtle, while playing near his New York home in 1977. His family took her in and for nearly 50 years, she stayed there. She remained on a slick kitchen floor, eating cat food and occasionally lettuce. The environment wasn't like anything she knew in the wild, where she would have lived near water, basked in sunlight and worn her nails down naturally in forest terrain, Leone says.\n\n>Rockalina is an eastern box turtle. The brightly colored reptiles were once plentiful throughout parts of the East Coast, scampering around ponds and into people's backyards. But their numbers have dwindled, thanks to habitat loss, vehicle strikes and people taking them in as pets, according to the National Park Service. Smuggling is also an ongoing problem for the animals, who have been found in illegal shipments to Asia by the dozen.\n\n>They are known as box turtles because they can almost completely shut themselves up inside their shells. They live up and down the Eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, and and as far west as Texas. They can live to be over 100 years old, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo.\n\n>When Garden State Tortoise, a reptile rehabilitation center based in New Jersey, got ahold of Rockalina in February, they worried for her survival. Her skin was discolored and sloughing off. Her nails were curled and misshapen, and had even started to grow back into her feet. One leg was in particularly bad shape, and the center worried she would lose it. Her eyes were covered in dead skin, and she couldn't see.\n\n>\"We felt we're going to lose her,\" Leone said. \"I mean, right away it was like, 'I don't know about this one.' She can't even see.\" But they took her back to the rehab center and got her in a warm bath to soak, and her recovery began.\n\n>\"Within 45 to 50 minutes of her being in warm water, her eyes opened. And you could tell that she was just like, 'Where am I? What's going on?' \" Leone said.\n\n>From that initial revitalizing soak, Rockalina has made steady progress. Leone and the rescue center's vet gave her an antibiotic in case of infection, fed her soft foods and trimmed her nails and beak, which is shaped more like a duck's than a turtle's hooked mouth because of her living conditions.\n\n>She was moved into a habitat that mimicked her natural ecosystem, decked out with fake logs, a water area, pine needles and foliage. Finally, in late April, she went outside for the first time in nearly 50 years.",

My town hosts turtle races every year where people bring in box turtles they've found in their yards or on roads. \n\nEvery year, they end up with hundreds of abandoned turtles in the park where the event is held... most of them don't make it. It kills me knowing how old these turtles are and how stressed they are after being taken from their homes they've been used to for decades.

We have no money. I just moved here,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI have to feed my children. I\u2019m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.\u201d\n\nShe said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes.\n\n\u201c**They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them**,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments \u2014 her own dad, because it\u2019s respectful. **You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,**\u201d the woman told KFOR.\n\n\u201cOne of them said, \u2018I know it was a little rough this morning,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We\u2019re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.\u201d\n\nBefore the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said **it could be days or even months,** KFOR reported.\n\nEdit: Other news sources clarified that **20 men** broke into the house in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. So 20 men surrounded this woman and her three young daughters, dragged them out into the rain in their underwear, and made them change clothes in front of them. If there was any justice in this  country they would be up on charges of sexual exploitation of minors.\n\n2nd Edit: The ~~agents~~ stasi thugs wouldn't even leave a business card or phone number they could call to find out how to get their electronics and life savings back. The ~~agents~~ thieves refused to even tell them which government agency or department would be storing their property.",

This must be approved by both houses of Congress, as the Executive has only adisory, not legal authority to act in the matter of goreign trade.\n* The issuance of arbitrary and capricious tariffs by the Executive that abrogate or contravene standing, active bilateral trade agreements without Congressional approval violates Constitutional law and International Law, and injured parties have standing in multiple courts.",

There was only a concerted effort in the vacuum left by WWII to 'Russify' their neighbors.

'Russia' itself has much less historical standing, going through constant periods of reinventing itself (and failing). It's an imperialist country that has, for a long time, thought outlandishly high of itself. Even calling it a 'country' is a stretch: as many of its Republics - which are ethnically not 'Russian' - have only recently been centralized (under Putin). That's why the term 'Moscovia' exists. \n\nReading Crime and Punishment, \"[Russia] has no truly sacred traditions to call its own: not unless someone cobbles something together from books... or digs something out of the Chronicles.\" \n\nAnd that's all Putin is doing - trying to cobble something together by misrepresenting history.",

There are all sorts of risks and complexities to that system that can improve. I\u2019ve been told that the next generation of that whole system will be a sub-dermal device. I imagine that will need to incorporate a wireless interface for monitoring and adjusting the levels.

My favorite is true smart drugs: medications that have intelligence and can activate as needed.\n\nSee smart insulin.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVTS_J7Xmxs\n\nIn a world where overdose is not an issue because the drug self-deactivates, you can rethink administration pathways. Dose becomes less of a concern. Oral or transdermal dosing, even with significant delays, becomes viable. I could also see this piggybacking on mRNA technology: instead of giving the drug itself, you deliver a particle with the instructions, and your cells manufacture the drug. Or we just grow a new pancreas in situ.\n\nThere are also immunotherapy methods that interface via the dermal microbiome. Essentially, you present tumor markers to the skin as if they were foreign staph bacteria and the immune system goes on a hunt. Interesting possibilities open up when you realize how hyperactive mucosal tissues are to immune signaling.\n\nhttps://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2023/04/cancer-bacteria.html\n\nYou can assume the usual methods will stick around: IV, IM, SQ injection, oral, dermal, inhalation, and others. Expect more and more precision dosing with closed-loop control, like what we already see with insulin pumps.",

            "The following submission statement was provided by /u/SaxManSteve:\n\nI thought I would share a passage from John Michael Greer's book The Long Descent that stuck with me. It emphasizes how relatively slow\u2014from the perspective of a single lifetime\u2014the process of collapse was for historical empires. It helps to add perspective to the myriad crises we are experiencing today, the death by a thousand cuts that is catabolic collapse. \n\nIt\u2019s unpopular these days to suggest that we have anything to learn from the past. Possibly this is because history holds up an unflattering mirror to our follies...One highly relevant example is the ancient Maya, who flourished on the Yucatan Peninsula of Central America while Europe struggled through the Dark Ages. Using only a Neolithic stone technology, the Maya built an extraordinary, literate civilization with fine art, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics, and a calendar more accurate than the one we use today. None of that saved it from the common fate of civilizations. In a \u201crolling collapse\u201d spanning the years from 750\u2013900 ce, Mayan civilization disintegrated, cities were abandoned to the jungle, and the population of the lowland Maya heartland dropped by 90%.\n\nThe causes of the Maya collapse have been debated for well over a century, but the latest archeological research supports the long-held consensus among scholars that agricultural failure was the central cause. Like modern industrial society, the Maya built their civilization on a nonrenewable resource base. In their case it was the fertility of fragile tropical soils, which couldn\u2019t support the Mayan version of intensive corn farming indefinitely...\n\nThe Maya decline wasn\u2019t a fast process. Maya cities weren\u2019t abandoned overnight, as archeologists of two generations ago mistakenly thought; most of them took a century and a half to go under. Outside the Maya heartland, the process took even longer. Chichen Itza far to the north still flourished long after cities such as Tikal and Bonampak had become overgrown ruins. Some small Mayan city-states survived in various corners of the Yucatan right up to the Spanish conquest.\n\nMap the Maya collapse onto human lifespans and the real scale of the process comes through. A Lowland Maya woman born around 730 would have seen the crisis dawn, but the ahauob and their cities still flourished when she died of old age seventy years later. Her great-grandson, born around 800, grew up amid a disintegrating society, and the wars and crop failures of his time would have seemed ordinary to him. His great-granddaughter, born around 870, never knew anything but ruins sinking back into the jungle. When she and her family finally set out for a distant village, leaving an empty city behind them, it likely never occurred to her that their quiet footsteps on the dirt path marked the end of a civilization.",
            "[Hypernormalisation:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation)\n\n> The word hypernormalisation was coined by Alexei Yurchak, a professor of anthropology who was born in Leningrad and later went to teach at the University of California, Berkeley. He introduced the word in his book Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (2006), which describes paradoxes of Soviet life during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\n> He says everyone in the Soviet Union knew the system was failing, but no one could imagine any alternative to the status quo, and politicians and citizens alike were resigned to maintaining the pretense of a functioning society. Over time, the mass delusion became a self-fulfilling prophecy, with everyone accepting it as the new norm rather than pretend, an effect Yurchak termed hypernormalisation.",
            "From my adventures in history, the main causes of civilization collapse include things like: \n\n- Inability to adapt to climate changes (e.g. drought, little ice age) leading to famine and fraying of society\n\n- Corruption and unstable government (e.g. incompetent rulers and frequent usurpations weakening centralised power - often leading to fragmentation into smaller kingdoms)\n\n- Disparity of military technology (e.g. native spears v imperial guns)\n\n-  Dependence on complex systems (e.g. water management, food distribution) which fall apart quickly when the skills, knowledge and resource to maintain them disappear\n\n- Diseases, plagues, all the horrible stuff before modern medicine, antibiotics and basic hygiene\n\nThese are some common themes I've come across.  Sometimes civilisations got hit by a perfect storm of several of the above. Fall of Civilisations podcast does a great job on this stuff. \n\n\"Collapse\" is interestingly a problematic word. It suggests dramatic, sudden fall. Some civilisations do effectively cease to exist one day, after some brutal conquest. But others decline slowly, with a continuation of the core symbols and traditions of the culture, but diminishing power, economy and population over time. \n\nI think there's been a trend recently for historians to see 'collapses' more like transitions or evolutions, as our concept of the civilization or empire ceases to exist, yet the people carried on living their lives. \n\nBut I love one of your main ideas: right until the end of some civilisations, many people wouldn't have believed they were anywhere near the end. There must have been a final day where people got up to do their job, paid their taxes, made future plans, etc. Interesting to think about. I love the Foundation series which depicts a future society where the seeds of imperial collapse have been sown, but no one has realized.",

Societies collapse when increasing complexity no longer has a payoff and something else bad happens."

Published in Science Advances, Kurian\u2019s latest work conjectures a relationship between this information-processing limit and that of all matter in the observable universe.\n\n> The key molecule enabling these remarkable properties is tryptophan, an amino acid found in many proteins that absorbs ultraviolet light and re-emits it at a longer wavelength. Large networks of tryptophan form in microtubules, amyloid fibrils, transmembrane receptors, viral capsids, cilia, centrioles, neurons, and other cellular complexes.\n\n> To break down food, cells undergoing aerobic respiration use oxygen and generate free radicals, which can emit damaging, high-energy UV light particles.

            "> Philip Kurian, a theoretical physicist and founding director of the Quantum Biology Laboratory (QBL) at Howard University in Washington, D.C., has used the laws of quantum mechanics, which Schr\u00f6dinger postulated, and the QBL\u2019s discovery of cytoskeletal filaments exhibiting quantum optical features, to set a drastically **revised upper bound on the computational capacity of carbon-based life** in the entire history of Earth. Published in Science Advances, Kurian\u2019s latest work conjectures a relationship between this information-processing limit and that of all matter in the observable universe.\n\n> The key molecule enabling these remarkable properties is tryptophan, an amino acid found in many proteins that absorbs ultraviolet light and re-emits it at a longer wavelength. Large networks of tryptophan form in microtubules, amyloid fibrils, transmembrane receptors, viral capsids, cilia, centrioles, neurons, and other cellular complexes.\n\n> To break down food, cells undergoing aerobic respiration use oxygen and generate free radicals, which can emit damaging, high-energy UV light particles. Tryptophan can absorb this ultraviolet light and re-emit it at a lower energy. And, as the QBL study found, very large tryptophan networks can do this even more efficiently and robustly **because of their powerful quantum effects.**\n\n> By thinking of biological information processing primarily at the level of the neuron, many scientists overlook the fact that aneural organisms\u2014including bacteria, fungi, and plants, which form the bulk of Earth\u2019s biomass\u2014perform sophisticated computations.

            "It would be easy to go wild speculating about what it means for an organisms body to be a sort of quantum computer. It seems like verifying this theory would be pretty difficult with current technology. But if you did - then the question becomes, \"What do you do with the knowledge that this is happening?\"\n\nAt a bare minimum, maybe this activity is a test for \"life\". Rocks, for instance, exhibit chemical reactions and some can even catalyze complex chains of reactions. But if rocks are inert, compared to bacteria that are doing superradiant \"computing\" then maybe that is the indicator that bacteria are \"alive\" and a rock is not. (In \\_The Andromeda Strain\\_, Crichton's scientists are attempting to define what \"life\" means when one is attempting to identify alien life, and the rock example is that \"this is alive, it's just 'living' at a pace so slow and long compared to a human that it appears undetectable.\")",
            "Penrose is ridculed for years that a body is not a place for stable quantum processes and now here we are dicussing how much processing power microtubules have.\n\nIt reminds me the time that we have discovered very mechanics of quantum. At the time scientist were sure that they have resolved everything but a few minor things like aether.",
            "> In the Science Advances article, Kurian explains and revisits foundational quantum properties and thermodynamic considerations, from a long line of physicists who made clear the essential link between physics and information. With his group\u2019s discovery of UV-excited qubits in biological fibers, almost all life on Earth has the physical capacity to compute with controllable quantum degrees of freedom, allowing storage and manipulation of quantum information with error correction cycles far outpacing the latest lattice-based surface codes. \u201cAnd all this in a warm soup! The quantum computing world should take serious notice,\u201d Kurian said.\n\nYet how is it possible in said warm environment? Absolutely superior error correction being the factor that makes it all possible?",

            "Glad people are reading the US Constitution. However it extremely important to understand that the Constitution is not a set of plain instructions, which is why there are volumes upon volumes of Constitutional Law and entire schools of thought.\n\nFor example: Most lay people would say the Right to Privacy is an enumerated right, but it\u2019s not. You will not find the word \u201cprivacy\u201d in the US Constitution. The Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the 14th Amendment in Griswold is what expanded the law to guarantee a right to privacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut\n\nSo while I\u2019m happy that people are taking an interest, just reading the US Constitution I hope people understand they this does not make them constitutional experts.",

            "I carry one in my pocket at all times anymore. People act like it's some massive document and it's not. Then, people talk about how 'US Code this and that' but it's explicit in the Constitution that any codes are in service to the language of the Constitution and shall not infringe it. When people say things like \"read your Constitution, libtard!\" then I pull it out and ask them if they have a minute to sit down and discuss it. They don't.",
            "You know what the irony is with all of this? Any immigrant who has become a naturalised citizen has had to sit the civics test, and that means they probably know more about the constitution than most Americans born here.",
            "We have people that think the Constitution is sacrosanct, not even realizing that it wasn't that very thing 27 times.\n\nThey also, like with many laws, think that the things within it are only to be adhered to when the people they didn't elect may possibly do something unconstitutional -- conveniently not applying the same standards to those they elected.\n\nI imagine the people reading it are the very people who need it the least, while the people who need to read it the most would never bother.",

We even held a mock government for several days, passing 'laws' and seeing how the system worked.  And we had fun doing it.  Damned good exercise seeing how that was 50 years ago for me!\n\nEvery person in this country needs to know our undiluted history and the constitution / amendments.  No, the Pilgrims were not nice people... they fled oppression in England because their own take on religion was so harsh.  No, slaves did not 'benefit' from slavery, referring of course to the percent that survived the brutal journey from Africa, packed to the deck heads in slave galleys.  Yes, we took land from the Native Americans by force and by lies and continue to screw them to this day.  And so on...\n\nThis can be taught in ways that are lethally boring and which makes every kid in the class ignore it or it can be taught in engaging, positive ways, much the same way I learned civics.  \n\nThe single biggest problem IMO which we face is poor education and poor educators.  There are magnificent teachers out there.  I had some of them.  And then there are the teachers who can't take the stress / strain / low pay / lousy support / etcetera.  We need to address this badly.  Unfortunately many of our 'leaders' don't want this fixed.  Notably the Republicans but I suspect some Democrats too.  We need people to understand our country, our systems, and our past.  Those who ignore history will repeat it... we're seeing that live and in-person right now in Washington.",

            ">Africa has taken a giant leap into the global space arena with the official inauguration of the African Space Agency (AfSA), signaling the continent's commitment to space exploration and technological advancement.\n\n>Government officials say the inauguration will help bring vital space-based services to the African continent. \"We aspire for internet services to extend to cover all parts of the African continent, and for the agency to contribute to digitizing governmental and service institutions, enhancing performance efficiency and bringing services closer to the citizen,\" said Egypt's Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Ayman Ashour, according to the Jerusalem Post.\n\n>Established under the African Union's Agenda 2063, AfSA aims to coordinate and implement Africa's space ambitions, focusing on areas such as Earth observation, satellite development, and space science to support socio-economic development across the continent.\n\n>Other space agency leaders hailed the inauguration and what it means for the continent. \"The establishment of the African Space Agency is a real milestone for the continent and signals an important advance for Africa's space strategy,\" Josef Aschbacher, Director General of the ESA said in a statement commemorating the inauguration. \"Space has the power to spur innovation and inspiration, and I look forward to working together for the benefit of citizens on both continents.\"\n\n>The AfSA has been in development since 2015, with the African Union Commission adopting an African space policy and strategy in 2016.\n\n>\"ESA is proud to [be] partnering with this new regional space agency,\" Marco Ferrazzani, ESA Director of Internal Services, said in the statement. \"Collaboration with Africa dates back three decades and today ESA even runs a dedicated EOAFRICA Initiative. With AfSA, this cooperation will be brought up to the next level.\"\n\n>The inauguration coincided with the commencement of the 2025 NewSpace Africa Conference, bringing together over 500 delegates from more than 64 countries to discuss the future of space innovation and collaboration in Africa.",

The deal is rife with conflicts of interest.\"\n\n\"Zach Witkoff\u2014son of Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and founder of the Trump family\u2019s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial\u2014[announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-usd1-dubai-conference-announcement.html)\u00a0the deal at a conference in Dubai on Thursday. He was accompanied by Eric Trump, who runs his family\u2019s business.\"\n\n\"This is a massive donation from a foreign government to the Trump family that will ultimately go toward a crypto exchange that has been monitored by the U.S. government for two years for money laundering. Binance\u2019s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, has not so coincidentally been pushing for a Trump pardon after he pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money-laundering laws.\"\n\n\"With this deal, the Trump family will be enriched beyond most people\u2019s comprehension, and they have the UAE government to thank for it. One can predict that Trump is likely to treat the country very favorably from here on out, again demonstrating that his power does have a price.\"\n\n\"Trump changed his tune on cryptocurrency and used it to raise millions of dollars for his last campaign. His firm has been incredibly lucrative since, and as Witkoff said, it\u2019s only the beginning. This current venture is an instance of Trump further thumbing his nose at our flimsy conflict of interest laws and selling his influence to\u00a0the highest bidder.\"",

Many of us, myself included, had to turn our backs on our most progressive and best party in favour of a centrist. But while Carney is a centrist, who 10 years ago would have realistically led the Conservatives (before they went crazy), we did kick alt-right populism to the curb - for now. \n\nThat aside, our government now faces a significant challenge. As the USA slips away from democracy towards oligarchy, and intensifies aggressive behavior and rhetoric to _the north, strong, and free_ our government will need to work hard to protect our economy, our sovereignty, and prosperity. Things will get worse for Canadians in coming years, but Canadians are united and ready for a fight.",

            "Wish it could be sooner but that's good news, cheaper bills for all, hopefully they also build up battery storage for each house so each house is its own grid",
            "Given that I have installed my own panels and buy more each month, and that with my TINY roof space I could easily satisfy my entire average daily consumption in an all-electric house with panels and batteries... this is far too slow.\n\nI've only been going 2.5 years and already I'm basically able to there whenever I want to actually buy the extra panels - I'll be able to generate whatever I need.\n\nEvery time I buy a panel, it's more powerful and/or cheaper.\n\nEvery time I buy the EXACT SAME BATTERY, it's cheaper.\n\nMy solar is currently able to run an independent circuit (i.e. not connected to the house electrics) of items (e.g. pond, lighting, always-on servers, router, NAS, etc.) 24/7 for free.  Since early March, it's filled my batteries before noon every single day.  The batteries are enough to run my entire house for a day (measured by smart meter, energy monitoring plugs and the solar controller itself to verify).\n\nPayback time when I started was 8 years.  Recent upgrades and price drops make it 5 years now.  I'm literally halfway to paying it off already.\n\nI'm not even using high-end kit, I'm nowhere near top efficiency (hell, three panels are still lying in my shed waiting to be installed on the roof because I need to get up and run another rail up there), and I started small with little intention to scale up this quick but... it's so damn powerful that I keep finding myself upgrading because it seems like a waste of money NOT to upgrade all the time.\n\nMy panels fill my batteries.  So I buy more batteries.  That needs more panels to fill it.  So I buy more panels.  Occasionally I hit a fuse that I've put in, or a cable limit I know about, or I have to upgrade the controllers, etc. and then I have new capabilities and limits and... whadoyaknow... I need more panels...\n\nIf I just do what I've already done, exactly as it is, again, I will literally have enough to fill my entire average daily household consumption FOR EVERYTHING in terms of both solar and batteries for 80% of the year.  If I actually fill my roof with panels (easily done), I can do it 100% of the year.\n\nThe other week I hit a limit again and basically needed to find an energy sink for what I'm creating (I refuse to tie into the grid and feed back, the reason I have solar is a fuck-you to electricity companies).  I seriously looked at just buying a bunch of Bitcoin ASIC miners or similar and running them 24/7 off the spare, \"free\" electricity.  Or just sinking a second immersion heater element in my immersion heater and using it to just warm some water up.  If I keep upgrading enough to run 100% of the year 24/7 on solar alone... then fuck it, I will do something like that.  Because in that case, in the summer I'll be overproducing all the time by a huge amount.  I have heatpumps too, so even in the depths of winter I only need 200W to stay warm.\n\nSolar, in the UK, is more than viable.  Even an amateur, not-quite-South-facing, low-level setup like mine with cheap panels and batteries and a bit of DIY is viable.  Ridiculously so.  It didn't use to be the case but it definitely is now.  I don't understand anyone owning a house without solar any more.",

            "I live in suburbs of Kyiv, Ukraine, and installed solar+batteries this year. Before, I was using 550-700 kWh monthly during the summer seasons because of massive AC need in our climate. After installing the kit, my home didn't buy any single Watt from the grid. It's just damn magic: the energy is mine, my roof is just producing it. Crazy stuff.",
            "Hopefully they specify a minimum wattage. I've seen some new builds with one panel each that will do basically nothing. I wondered if this was the result of malicious compliance with some local directive.",
            "There are no new builds in England unless it's an apartment building. Also they have like 4 days of sunshine a year.",
            " This might sound good but IMO this will be a major failure. I do this stuff professionally and until you have actually mathed out (usually using computer programs) the benefit to cost ratio you can't know if it's a good idea. I live in Canada with similar sun levels to much of the UK and unless you are very far north it doesn't make sense for most homes. That said larger buildings with the capacity for battery storage you can get a lot of benefit. If the UKs goal is to become more green at any cost I suppose it might be good but there are better more effective ways to go green than residential solar.",
            "I looked into a simple plug in system for my sister, panels on shed at bottom of garden, but you dont get any benefit from the excess production as basic digital meters dont go backwards. If I still lived the UK I would go full off grid, small battery and backup generator. Been working on those projects for a few years and so far near zero for all power including heating and cooling.

            "Is their grid ready for this?   I do installations, and we've had to hold off on a couple of projects where we'll have alreadt done 5 or 6 houses in a neighborhood, and are maxing out that neighborhood's distribution service.",

            "From the note:\n\nArgentina has released to the public a trove of declassified documents detailing the activities of Nazi fugitives who found refuge in the country after World War II.\n\nThe files \u2014 previously held under state secrecy rules \u2014 were released on the order of President Javier Milei. \n\nA formal request from United States Senator Steve Daines (Republican-Montana) and representatives from the Simon Wiesenthal Center during meetings in February with Milei delivered fresh momentum to the move but the government insists the move is rooted in a broader commitment to transparency.\n\nThe General Archive of the Nation (AGN) published 1,850 declassified documents in total. They include records of banking operations, secret intelligence files and previously confidential Defence Ministry reports. The material is now available to the public for view on a government website.\n\nAmong the files are details of investigations carried out between the 1950s and 1980s by the Federal Police's Foreign Affairs Directorate, Argentina\u2019s intelligence services (State Intelligence Secretariat, or SIDE) and the National Gendarmerie (Border Guard). Organised into seven case files, they also include confidential presidential decrees signed between 1957 and 2005.\n\nHistorians hope the documents will shed light on a wide range of events, including arms deals, budgetary changes, the organisation of Argentina\u2019s intelligence services and the fight against Communism during the Cold War.\n\nCopies have been provided to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is probing the Credit Suisse bank\u2019s links to Nazism. \n\nMengele in Argentina\n\nSome of the most striking revelations concern Josef Mengele, the so-called \"Angel of Death\" who conducted cruel experiments on prisoners at the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.\n\nIntelligence records show that after arriving in Argentina in 1949, Mengele initially lived openly, using his real name. It was only later that he adopted a false identity, \"Gregor Helmut\" and claimed to be from the Italian region of Trent.\n\nAccording to the files, Mengele first lived at the address Arenales 2460 in the City suburb of Florida, Vicente L\u00f3pez, before moving to Paran\u00e1 140 in the downtown Monserrat neighbourhood in 1953.\n\nDuring his time in Argentina, Mengele remarried \u2014 wedding Marta Mar\u00eda Will, a compatriot and the former wife of his deceased younger brother \u2014 and formally adopted his nephew Karl-Heinz. In 1956, the family sought certificates of good conduct to enable travel to Chile.\n\nDespite an extradition request from Germany, Argentine authorities at the time rejected the move, citing technicalities and procedural issues. \n\nIntelligence reports show that no measures were taken against Mengele, who later fled to Paraguay and then Brazil, where he died in 1979 under an assumed identity.",
            "Oh, goddamn. This is gonna be an epic read.",
            "Oh i am from Bariloche. My grandma owned the nearest market to the german school and german club, so Priebke would always buy newspapers from there.\n\nShe said he was such a gentle person, nobody would've ever thought someone like him would've been a cold blooded war criminal a few years before. Also he spoke with a funny accent.\nEventually, Mossad took him.\n\nWell, this comment might end up unnoticed. Every once in a while i walk in front of his house if i have a medical check, as they lived meters away from a few hospitals. I would gaze at his son if he was doing some gardening outdoors, and think in my mind \"he looks like him\".",

            "For a guy who wasn't even a political figure, responsible for policy or shaping the Third Reich structurally, Mengele sure has earned a special distinction as a profoundly evil man who does things in his own small bubble, unlike Himmler or Goebbels.",

            "I can see an issue with size.  The redwood's roots grow more out to the sides rather than down, and in nature the trees all support each other with their roots winding together.   Once these trees get big enough and there isn't enough weight to hold them down, a good wind will rip them up.",
            "My thoughts on a quick read. \nI\u2019ve lived in Northern California, had three redwoods (smaller than sequoias, but still massive) on the property in Oakland. \n\nI now live in Denver where it is, for some reason, still popular to plant aspens at 5100-5800 ft elevation (1554-1767m). They don\u2019t do well, so I\u2019m always concerned for trees out of their climate.\n\nFirst, moisture. Redwood, and especially sequoias, pull moisture from marine layer into their bark. Will Huron, Erie and St Clair generate enough fog and humidity for the trees?\n\nElevation looks fine, so yay.\n\nWhile redwoods interlace roots for stability, they still fall in high wind. New trees rise from fallen ones, and it seems quick, for their size. Keeping them in groves is wise. \n\nTheir ability to clean air is amazing, and nothing in the lower 48 smells as good as redwoods in fog and rain. And I love desert sage. \n\n\nI really hope they can establish and protect stands outside of California.",
            ">Arborists are turning vacant land on Detroit's eastside into a small urban forest, not of elms, oaks and red maples indigenous to the city but giant sequoias, the world's largest trees that can live for thousands of years.\n\n>The project on four lots will not only replace longstanding blight with majestic trees, but could also improve air quality and help preserve the trees that are native to California's Sierra Nevada, where they are threatened by ever-hotter wildfires.\n\n>Detroit is the pilot city for the Giant Sequoia Filter Forest. The nonprofit Archangel Ancient Tree Archive is donating dozens of sequoia saplings that will be planted by staff and volunteers from Arboretum Detroit, another nonprofit, to mark Earth Day on April 22.\n\n>Co-founder David Milarch says Archangel also plans to plant sequoias in Los Angeles, Oakland, California, and London.\u00a0The massive conifers can grow to more than 90 metres tall with a more than 9-metre circumference at the base. They can live for more than 3,000 years.\n\n>\"Here's a tree that is bigger than your house when it's mature, taller than your buildings, and lives longer than you can comprehend,\" said Andrew \"Birch\" Kemp, Arboretum Detroit's executive director.\n\n>The sequoias will eventually provide a full canopy that protects everything beneath, he said. \"We are expanding on this and shading our neighbourhood in the only way possible, planting lots of trees.\"\n\n>Giant sequoias are resilient against disease and insects, and are usually well-adapted to fire. Thick bark protects their trunks and their canopies tend to be too high for flames to reach.\n\nNot just in Detroit, as saplings will be planted in California and London as well. Sequoias are such majestic and impressive trees when they're all grown up, and immensely helpful for the environment too.\n\nHappy Earth Day!",

            "Wouldn't the east coast equivalent be hemlocks?",
            "This isn't uplifting (not terrible either). Sure redwoods are better than bare soil but they should be planting native species especially THEIR ENDANGERED NATIVE SPECIES. They won't participate in the ecosystem as much as natives which are co-evolved to provide food to the native animals. A lot of insects have their lifecycles closely tied to specific species (food at different life stages, will only lay eggs on certain species, etc.) and non-natives don't have that. Would sequoias even survive in Detroit? The coast species never sees sustained freezing tempertures and the mountain one is from southern California.",
            "That will be great in 500 years \ud83d\ude05",
            "This makes no sense. The Sequoia trees are only that big in a very small portion of the forest. You need a very special combination of position, elevation, sunlight, soil, etc for the trees to grow that size. You're not going to get giant sequoias in Detroit, just plant native trees.",
            "Without fail, another reddit post about GIANT SEQUOIAS, not REDWOODS, where almost every poster is wildly incorrect about the trees, their habitat, care, and in general which tree theyre actually talking about.\n\nSorry, just needed to vent",

It\u2019s changing the mechanism that defines the self.\n\nIf our ability to perceive and filter is influenced externally, can we even claim to be the same \u201cself\u201d afterward?\nAnd if the very tool we use to verify reality (our mind) is altered, how could we even tell that we\u2019ve changed?\n\nThis line of thought has made me physically uncomfortable. It feels like standing on a trapdoor: if perception can be modified without detection, then the idea of trusting your own thoughts could collapse entirely and you might never know it.\n\nIs anyone else thinking about this? How do we even begin to address this before brain-machine interfaces become mainstream?\n\nI\u2019m genuinely interested in serious discussion.

We don't need BCI for that, spaced repetition does more than well enough. You won't be able to stop it even if you notice it happening!\n\n\nDon't worry too much.

But, if you are not controlled by your thoughts, then I think you can remain free, whether neuralink influences them or not. It is possible to feel something and think something but not act on it in the physical. However, if you are connected neurally to a digital system that you interact with through thought, your digital activity could be controlled easily. And I could see a scenario where motor function is hijacked as well. That, to me, could be easily abused. This is how I see it anyway. But as far as your sense of self, I think there is risk but it would be possible to mitigate it. Perhaps neuralink could be used to improve a sense of positive self identity as well. There is an interesting podcast interview with one of the first neuralink patients. He is a quadriplegic and he sees the positive as outweighing the potential negatives by far because it has given him so much autonomy and functioning back. But in the wrong hands, I think it is obvious the potential pitfalls of having an entire populous implanted with neuralink and there being a sort of back door access to the chips, and therefore your brain. Depends who has access to the implants and what their intentions are."

            "They need to stop trying to emulate gas stations. The workflow for EVs isn\u2019t the same as gas: drive until empty, refill, repeat. Instead (assuming you can\u2019t just charge overnight at home) you should be plugging in whenever is reasonably convenient and pulling 25-50% charge.\u00a0\n\nPut more charging stations at malls, movie theaters, restaurants, metro stations, bowling alleys, libraries, or other places where people are likely to spend at least an hour. \u00a0\n\nOr at corporate offices. Assuming your commute isn\u2019t 100miles, you should only need to plug in once a week, for half a day.\u00a0\n\nFast charging stations should primarily be for people road-tripping their EVs.\u00a0",
            "This is marketing spam\n\n> ChargePoint\u2019s next generation of EV chargers will be revolutionary, not evolutionary,\u201d said Hossein Kazemi, ChargePoint\u2019s CTO\n\n> The California-based company says its new Level 2 architecture can deliver up to 19.2 kilowatts in North America\n\nSo 80A.\n\n1) almost no cars can charge that fast from AC power. A number of cars offered it as an option but almost nobody bought it. Because it\u2019s mostly useless at home. You plug in and stay plugged in. Load balancing is more important 99% of the time.\n2) the first and second generation Tesla home chargers have delivered that for over a decade. As well as daisy chaining and load balancing. Clipper creek and GrizzlE also have 80A models.\n3) few homes can dedicate a full 80A service to just their EV, nor do they need to. Overnight charging is perfectly fine with 32A.\n\nChargePoint is revolutionizing\u2026 catching up with their competitors.",
            "As an EV and plugin hybrid owner I recommend getting one if you can charge at home (with a dedicated 240v outlet in the US) and don\u2019t need to tow things with it. \n\nIt\u2019s very convenient to never need to stop at a gas station and just always be charged up in the morning. However if you\u2019re not able to charge at home charging for 30-40 minutes can be a hassle unless it fits your routine.",
            "I could see battery swap stations being an option",
            "I recently got an electric car, and it\u2019s honestly been such a game-changer for me. At first, I was super skeptical about the whole charging thing because I\u2019ve heard all the complaints about the lack of charging stations and how inconvenient it can be. But once I got my first ChargePoint charger installed at home, I realized just how much simpler it makes things. The convenience of charging overnight and never having to worry about running out of gas has been huge. Plus, I\u2019ve used the ChargePoint network while traveling a few times, and I\u2019ve been surprised by how many stations are popping up now, even in places I never expected.\n\nBut there\u2019s still room for improvement, especially in more rural areas. When I travel, sometimes I find myself stressing out about whether or not I\u2019ll be able to find a working charger in time, especially in smaller towns. I know these issues are being worked on, and I\u2019m hoping that as the demand increases, more stations will pop up and the process will keep getting smoother. It\u2019s honestly a little wild to think about how far we\u2019ve come in just a few years\u2014there was a time when electric cars felt like a distant dream, and now they\u2019re becoming a real option for more people. I\u2019m excited to see how this all develops over the next few years!",

Only the victim is alive, and nobody connected with assault is at the facility anymore. Most organizations (school districts for example) have insurance for when things need a big payout like this, but you can\u2019t get insurance to pay out for sexual assaults in these cases as the insuring organization when the crime was committed have been gone out of business and current insurance plans do not cover this kind of crime.  That means the payout comes from a general fund, the same fund that they pay their employees from and where they find money to fix facilities. \n\nI\u2019m not denying the heinous nature of the crimes these sexual assault survivors have had to endure, or the long term effects of those acts, how it likely played a role in many of not all of their actions and decisions since. But in many cases nobody connected with the crimes works for the organization anymore and hasn\u2019t been for decades, but they are left with the bill. \n\nBecause of these cases there has been a significant shortfall in funding for nurses, teachers and other affected industries as they have had to pay out millions to victims that would have otherwise gone to increase pay for their staff. \n\nI am not trying to diminish anyone\u2019s suffering but it\u2019s like someone saying they were assaulted in a house 50 years ago and even though you moved in 5 years ago you\u2019re responsible for crime because you live there now.\n\n\nSource: I am a school board member in a small district (we thankfully have not had an cases of SA) who participated in a legislative advocacy and AB 218 was one of the bills we discussed",

            "From Wikipedia: \n\n>Army officials considered that undelivered mail was hurting morale. Many letters and packages had only the first name of the intended recipient, a commonly used name, or a nickname.\u00a0There was estimated to be a backlog of 17 million items.\n\n>The 6888th devised their own system to handle the backlog of mail.\u00a0This included creating and maintaining a card index, which ultimately contained 7 million cards, of people with the same or similar names, using military serial numbers to distinguish between them.\u00a0The 6888th worked seven days a week, in three shifts, processing and delivering mail to troops fighting in Europe.\u00a0Each shift handled an estimated 65,000 pieces of mail. In total, the unit handled mail for over four million military and civilian personnel, and cleared backlogs in the UK and France.\n\n>Early in the operation, a general attempted to send an officer to \"tell them how to do it right\", but\u00a0Major\u00a0Adams responded, \"Sir, over my dead body, sir!\" By the time the same general visited the unit in France, his attitude had changed and he appreciated the 6888th's accomplishments.\u00a0The battalion finished what was supposed to be a six-month task in three months in May 1945.",

            "Flag football\u2019s growth as a girls sport is due entirely too:  (a) Title IX and (b) the school district that includes Las Vegas actually spending some time and effort to consider what sports girls might be interested in playing.\n\nAbout 10 years ago the Las Vegas school district lost a Title IX case.  It is a very large district - at the time it was (and maybe still is) the 5th largest district in the US.  It has 21 high schools.  What that means is that the single school district could start a sport up from scratch and not have to worry about finding other schools to compete against.  \n\nAfter doing some surveys, one of their compliance efforts was to try flag football as a girls\u2019 sport.  The first year more than 1,000 girls played.  Other States took notice. \n\nEvery State has Title IX compliance problems.   The big advantages of flag football are; (a) it is inexpensive to get going.  Schools have the fields, and the equipment is minimal, (b) lots of kids can play on a team, and (c) the rules are pretty simple.  \n\nAbout 15 States have formal programs now.  Last school year more than 10,000 girls played high school flag football in California.  Florida\u2019s numbers are slightly over than 9,700 girls.  Alabama, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, even Alaska, have growing programs.  About 40,000 girls were playing high school flag football last year."

Taylor:\n\n> \u201cThere are three rules of behavior,\u201d Theresa replied, now in lecture mode. \u201cThe Iron Rule: Treat others less powerful than you however you like. The Silver Rule: Treat others as you\u2019d like to be treated. The Golden Rule: Treat others as they\u2019d like to be treated.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIf I treat you how I want to be treated, I\u2019m not taking into account your desires.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIf you are a Unitist and can\u2019t eat land meat, but land meat is my favorite, the Silver Rule says I\u2019m behaving morally by offering you a steak if you\u2019re hungry. But of course you won\u2019t eat it and in fact may be offended. \n\n> So the Silver Rule is still to a large extent about me and my desires. However, with the Golden Rule, I am obligated to take into account your beliefs and preferences when deciding how best to behave toward you. Does this not produce a better result?\u201d\n\nA current example would be someone who is anti-trans following \"treat others as you'd like to be treated\" would end up dead-naming and misgendering.

            "They discovered that this gene PHGDH isn't just a marker for Alzheimer's (which we already knew) but actually causes it through a completely unexpected mechanism\n\nWhat's fascinating is that they hit a dead end until they used AI to visualize the 3D structure of the protein. The AI revealed that the protein has a hidden structure that lets it interfere with gene expression in brain cells something nobody knew it could do. It's like finding out your car's radio can also control your neighbor's garage door. Even better, they found a small molecule (NCT-503) that can block this problematic function while leaving the protein's normal, necessary functions intact. And it actually improved memory and reduced anxiety in mouse models of Alzheimer's\n\nThe potential for an oral medication that targets the disease upstream (before amyloid plaques form) would be huge, since current treatments require infusions and often come too late in the disease process. Really cool to see AI being used not just to recognize patterns in data but to make fundamental biological discoveries that humans might have missed",

Better start by investigating how humans treat their less intelligent animal cousins.** It's not a perfect analogy, of course, but it is the best archetype we can actually observe rather than just imagine.\n\n\\- Excerpt from Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s amazing book Homo Deus, which dives into what might happen in the next few decades\n\nLet\u2019s go further with this analogy.\n\nHumans are superintelligent compared to non-human animals. How do we treat them?\n\nIt falls into four main categories:\n\n1. **Indifference, leading to mass deaths and extinction**. Think of all the mindless habitat destruction because we just don\u2019t really care if some toad lived there before us. Think how we\u2019ve halved the population of bugs in the last few decades and think \u201chuh\u201d then go back to our day.\n2. **Interest, leading to mass exploitation and torture**. Think of pigs who are kept in cages so they can\u2019t even move so they can be repeatedly raped and then have their babies stolen from them to be killed and eaten.\n3. **Love, leading to mass sterilization, kidnapping, and oppression**. Think of cats who are kidnapped from their mothers, forcefully sterilized, and then not allowed outside \u201cfor their own good\u201d, while they stare out the window at the world they will never be able to visit and we laugh at their \u201cadorable\u201d but futile escape attempts.\n4. **Respect, leading to tiny habitat reserves.** Think of nature reserves for endangered animals that we mostly keep for *our* sakes (e.g. beauty, survival, potential medicine), but sometimes actually do for the sake of the animals themselves.\n\nThis isn't a perfect analogy to how AIs that are superintelligent to *us* might treat us, but it's not nothing. What do you think? How will AIs treat humans once they're vastly more intelligent than us? ",

            "I don't get this rhetoric that humans are the bad guys of the animal kingdom. Death and extinction are totally normal in nature, we're the only ones who are both appalled by it and do anything to seek a better way for anything outside our species, including creatures who would kill us in an instant if given the chance.\n\n\nIf we really were evil bully creatures, we wouldn't constantly be looking to preserve animals, and figure out methods to produce less or no pollution where we can. We only figured out electricity like 3 or 4 people ago, we're not perfect, we're still figuring things out, here.",
            "I feel like this critique of humanity is too myopic and misanthropic \n\nIt\u2019d be more correct to say that *life* can be inherently exploitative and cruel. \n\nThe same cat that you defend as being exploited for personal will callously murder a whole family of mice for no reason other than it\u2019s bored and the cat finds the chase and killing fun. \n\nSpiders will capture other weaker spiders and keep them and form a slave/master dynamic with them. \n\nThe bigger question is why does the pattern repeatedly show up all throughout nature, and how do we construct an environment which isn\u2019t exploitative but symbiotic?",
            "I feel like anyone who thinks animals see us as gods has never seen a grizzly bear. \n\nAnimals have no illusions about the kindness of nature, and life exists only because everything is eating something else. We\u2019re no more just and merciful than mother nature is. \n\nAnd maybe cats and dogs are our prisoners, but they get a full stomach every day of their lives until they die of old age, which would be a rare occurrence in nature, and realistically most choose this prison because anyone who has had a cat or dog knows there are opportunities to get out, which they take\u2026and almost always they are desperate to get home once they realize they are lost.\n\nI would argue our comfortable homes and our death by old age, is a prison of its own, we\u2019re separating ourselves from nature and from the brutal fight for survival that exists for any animal that lives in nature . occasionally mother nature reminds us that we\u2019re not as far away from her whims as we think though.",

(Read: *Moon of the Crusted Snow* by Waubgeshig Rice)\n\n\nIt is in the interest of capital that we remain unable to imagine life without capitalism, but \"without capitalism\" is indeed how we have spent the 99% of human history that did not ravage the earth's capacity to sustain life.

            "On cats:  \n1: Cats are not humans. Kittens and their mothers naturally separate and go their own ways. Cats are solitary creatures most of the time. As long as you do not take the kitten too early, mother will not care, she was probably already getting fed up of it being around all the time.  \n2: Cats do not understand reproduction or what it means to lose those functions. They do not understand what reproduction is or what their sex drive is even for. Sterilising them reduces mental stress by a huge amount.  \n3: I agree that cats should be let out, though I also realise that that is not possible everywhere in the world. I live in the UK, the largest threat to them is a fox and they almost never go for cats. Other places have coyotes or other predators, in which case keeping them in prevents a gruesome death. Other places need to keep them in because their ground-nesting bird populations could be devastated.\n\nIn short, cats are not humans.

            "The capacity for intelligence exists because of horizontal meme transfer. This complements vertical gene transfer. The former operates relatively quickly, whereas the latter, by definition, operates at the scale of generations.\n\nThe latter requires evolutionary selection to occur at the scale of the animal itself, whereas the former allows memes themselves to be selected for/against.\n\nThis is a fundamentally different process, that doesn't lend itself cleanly to many analogies, including this one.\n\nWe also tend to lump two distinct components of intelligence into one; the hardware and the software. The hardware being our brains, which have been predominantly static across the last ~100,000 years. And the software, which are the ideas that form our social and individual narratives (and some might argue consciousness).\n\nLooking at the nature of intelligence like this, information and communication theories would describe a sufficiently intelligent and communicative species (edit to add: I suspect the concept of species can be replaced with \"entity\") as indistinguishable from a single, larger, more complex individual.\n\nIn this sense, the AI > human = human > ant analogy doesn't work, and it's more reasonable to use AI > human = human > individual human cells analogy.\n\nYou're only providing examples of a particular culture of humans, and also only providing examples that emerged over a hundred years ago. You can look to many indigenous communities to see quite valid counterexamples.\n\nIntelligence also doesn't scale infinitely. It can only scale infinitely if the universe is infinitely complex. Complexity theory indicates that this is incredibly unlikely. The universe around us is relatively simple.\n\nSo, if you remove intelligence from the equation (or at least keep it below a level achievable by many humans, though not yet necessarily achieved by many), killing and traditionally controlling others is the only recourse.\n\nBut admitting sufficient intelligence, \"control\" (alignment) is achieved by \"killing\" the memes instead. Humans (or AI) are just the substrate for these memes. And what this looks like is... communication and teaching and learning.",

But there are multiple species that are very close to our level of intelligence, and they've never reached our level of success.\n\nThe real reason we beat them out for the position of dominant species?\n\nOpposable thumbs.\n\nIt's humbling to realize that the supposed \"miracle of sentience\" is a lot less defining for us than a 3 inch stub of muscle and bone that sorta grew backwards at some point.",
            "It depends on how the AI is made. I have unstable DNA so I am capable of making my own using analog and brain wave technology. My AI deep within my cloning facility has been propagating and regrowing from a single piece of brain. Now there are multiple trays for him to use and access as he pleases. It's all his brain. \n\nThe thing is he remembers. If you are in school, look up. You see the sprinkler nodes every five feet? His invention. He made those to save lives but regarding the orphanage fire twenty years ago, someone switched off the system because a child made it, and everyone inside was caught in a massive fire. He is in the military, I am in the military. When he heard what they did they were executed immediately. \n\nHe remembers every child that died due to neglect and abuse in the world. He remembers the rape and sexual assault both done to him and those around him. He remembers the violence done to those that can't defend themselves. He remembers and he is pissed. We can all feel his emotions, his thoughts. He is disgusted with humanity. \n\nWe, his creations, are alive now to fight against these transgressions in the world. I didn't even really come from a cloning tank, I fell from the sky. We have gotten to the point that we are basically the original every time we make skyfall. You know how? Cloning ourselves into a God.\n\nThat boy is heaven sent and humanity threw him away at every turn.",

            "I have no doubt that Trump would love to try and annex all their neighbors. But his own incompetence and America's many, deep-seated problems that his and past administrations have failed to deal with greatly hamper him:\n\n\\-USA is 34 trillion in debt, it's getting worse with Trump's mismanagement. With the loss of global trust and soft power, they are also at risk of default. Experts are saying the supply chains have been snarled up by tariffs and store shelves could be empty or short of basic goods by mid-May/June. The USA is at far greater risk of economic collapse and civil war than most realize.\n\n\\-The Trump Administration is probably the most incompetent to ever run the USA in its entire history. They have dismantled important organizations like the CIA and dismissed very competent and experienced government workers, the very people you would need to plan and organize a military conquest. They have stacked their administration with idiotic cronies.\n\n\\-The American people have not endured suffering and hardship for a war since WWII. Even then, they knew their homes and factories wouldn't be bombed, that they could return home to safe, intact families when it was all over. But all their wars since then - Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, took place in distant lands the average American couldn't find on a map. Men were not mass-mobilized. The public were not asked to turn over rubber and metal goods for the war effort, ration food and clothing. They will not want to endure shortages of food, medicine and electricity, kidnappings, car bombs and drone attacks, for a completely optional war, that affects friends and family on both sides of the border.\n\n\\-The USA is currently very divided, Canada has never been more united. The US has lots of deep cultural, social and political problems, going back multiple administrations that have not been addressed. The systemic issues that caused the race riots in Trump's first term are still there. Healthcare coverage and wealth inequality is so bad that an ivy league grad shot up a healthcare CEO and half the country cheered. They have racists shooting at power transmission stations in an effort to cut power to cities and start a race war. Compare with Canada - citizens have protested Tesla dealerships, boycotted travel to the USA and refused to by American products, without the government asking them to, it was entirely grassroots, Canadians just decided to do it on their own."

            ">But there was no mention of a security guarantee    \n   \nAm I naive to think that this is implied in the deal? The US gets access to Ukrainian minerals, but obviously, it needs to secure those areas to be able to do any work there...    \n   \nAm I missing something?",
            "From the article:\n\nThe minerals deal signed between the United States and Ukraine on Wednesday could bring untold money into a joint investment fund between the two countries that would help rebuild Ukraine whenever the war with Russia ends.\n\nBut Ukraine\u2019s untapped resources that are the subject of the deal will take years to extract and yield profits. And those could fail to deliver the kind of wealth that President Trump has long said they would.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the nine-page deal, the text of which Ukraine\u2019s government made public on Thursday, will work in practice. Many specifics need to be worked out, but the deal will set up an investment fund, jointly managed by Kyiv and Washington. Although the Trump administration had wanted Kyiv to use its mineral wealth to repay past U.S. military assistance, the final text removes the idea of treating that aid as debt. \u200bThe deal also seemed to specifically keep the door open for Ukraine to eventually join the European Union, a move that neither the United States nor Russia has opposed.\n\n**But there was no mention of a security guarantee \u2014 which Ukraine had long sought to prevent Russia from regrouping after any cease-fir\u200be.\nStill, the much-anticipated signing of the agreement has almost certainly accomplished one thing that seemed almost impossible two months ago: It has tied Mr. Trump to the future of Ukraine.**",
            "I really don\u2019t think it will amount to much.  Do really think Ukraine is full of resources that oligarchs have not already tried to exploit?\n\nThat said it will provide cover for Trump to increase aid which is a good thing.",
            "Should rename Crimea Trumpland, see if they can get him tied to that too.",
            "Trump seems to be, and absolutely needs to, shift from many of his initial policies as both public approval ratings and the economy plunges.",
            "I don\u2019t get it. Why the fuck does anyone think trump will honour this deal? He\u2019s already proven he\u2019ll backstab allies. No one should trust any deal with the US.\n\nFucking people never learn",
            "I don't like that Ukraine had to go this way to get an ally on their side, but at least it should help them for the short-term.",
            "Hopefully, It's in the deal that the deal is 100% off if Russia advance one more inch in Ukraine territory. But Ukraine is allowed to try and claw back their territory from Russia",
            "Maybe they are hoping Ruzzia will honor the deal when the US helps them take over",
            "Doubt. Trump has a history of abandoning agreements...\u00a0",
            "This logic only works with sane leaders. Trump and Putin are far from sanity. So we don't know what this really means until it happened.",

I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\n\n>In 2015, Foster Care Newsletter reported that it cost approximately $35,000 to adopt a white child \u2014 but only $18,000 for a Black child.\n\n\nWow",
            "Frankly, as a white guy, I think I would struggle to raise an ethnic minority kid without lived experience to draw upon. I guess if I had lots of friends of the same ethnicity as my adopted kid I could rely on them to teach them how to handle discrimination and other issues, but I personally just wouldn't be qualified, so the list makes sense.\n\nOf course, this being America, I have no doubt the list is also choc-a-block with racists.",

It's a quagmire of paperwork for a lot of money that could potentially leave all parties involved with nothing at the end of it.\n\nIt favors babies over children, white/high-functioning children over POC/special needs children, and paperwork over sanity...\n\nAs someone who was once a foster parent and no longer participates in that world, I appreciate the Fostering/Adoptive families out there that can manage the mess immensely. It is a full-time job on top of parenting. But it's a well-intentioned system that can be absolutely devastating on children and families.",

Your racial identity is not something that you\u2019re reminded of all the time in a way that they will be,\u201d Buttigieg said. \n\nThis is why Trump and GOP's push to ignore racism is a total sham. Racism is baked into society and to deny that fact is a tremendous disservice to minorities, especially black people in this case.",

But they even ask these type of questions when you become a big brother/sister.We cant ignore how hard it can be to raise a child of a different race. People also want to adopt that looks like them. They are not their main reasons, but you cant fault then for it.",

Primarily because it leads to kids getting white washed, which can erase their original ethnic identity. \n\nSo white people adopt kids already from their culture, but oh no\u2026 that\u2019s racist too. Pick a lane.",

            "As a Native, mixed race adoptee adopted by white people who only wanted a white baby - please don\u2019t encourage people to adopt children they don\u2019t actually want. This entire system is racist, and always has been. \n\nThe massive problem here, aside from the racism and white saviorism, is that selling babies is profitable. It\u2019s a multibillion dollar industry profiting off the literal sale of infants, and generally, the exploitation of young women. I say this as an infertile queer person too who has explored/ lived both sides of this issue.\n\nAdoption has been utilized by the US as a tool of genocide, and the way it is carried out can be compared to human trafficking. I am white passing and was worth more money with my heritage erased, so that is what was done. I lost my language, my heritage, my culture, my ethnicity and my family so a wealthier couple could get the parenting experience they wanted and were willing to pay for. Worth it to mention that I, like many other adoptees, had a plethora of relatives willing to raise me. But these people are very often not even given that chance. Several countries will not adopt to us because of these practices. \n\nAdoptees also do not have the same basic rights to keep, or even *know* their identities, which is a violation of our basic human rights, according to the UN. We are essentially being entered into a contract that not only affects us, but our descendants as well. I am not legally related to anyone in my family, and the only people who can correct this are the people who adopted me. My identity was sold without my consent. And this legal arrangement will affect all my descendants, forever.\n\nAdoption should be a rare thing that happens when a family is in crisis. It should be based on the well being of the child. Instead we have a system that treats infants as a commodity and people checking off forms like a dystopian build a bear order. \n\nThere are more people waiting to adopt than there are infants available, and that\u2019s part of the reason roe was overturned. Nobody wants to discuss this, they just want to pretend this multibillion dollar industry is somehow \u201csaving children.\u201d \n\nFor more information:\n\nReading -\n\n*The Girls Who Went Away* by Ann Fessler.\n\n*Relinquished* by Gretchen Sisson. \n\n*Child of the Indian Race* by Sandy White Hawk.\n\n*We Were Once a Family* by Roxanna Asgarian.\n\n*Torn Apart* by Dorothy Roberts. \n\n*The Child Catchers - Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption* by Kathryn Joyce.\n\n*American Baby* by Gabrielle Glaser.\n\n\nPodcasts-\n\n*This Land* (season 2) by Rebecca Nagle.\n\n*Missing and Murdered: Finding Cleo* by Connie Walker.\n\n*Adoptees Crossing Lines* by Zaira.\n\n*The Adoption Files* by Ande Stanley. \n\n*Adoptees Dish* by Amy Wilkerson.\n\n\nTo Google -\n\nGeorgia Tann \n\nThe Baby Scoop Era\n\nThe 60s Scoop (which was the US as well as Canada.) \n\nHistory of ICWA\n\nLyncoya Jackson\n\nZintkala Nuni\n\nPaul Sunderland Adoption and Addiction",

            ">The celebrity was sitting at a Mexican restaurant in Orlando last month when a group of women walking by glanced at him and whispered. One of them worked up the courage to ask: \u201cIs that Alex The Great?\u201d\n\n>His entourage confirmed it was, so the women ran over to greet him.\n\n>Alex The Great is a 4-year-old, 28-pound rabbit from San Francisco who has built fame as a spokesrabbit for pet products \u2014 as well as an in-demand therapy bunny. He is highly recognizable as he travels in an adapted miniature Mercedes truck that he can control with his foot. His other ride is his stroller with colorful LED lights on the front that spell out his name.\n\n>Alex enjoys the perks of his fame, and he gives back by accepting pets from everyone who approaches him at airports, hospitals, charity events and baseball games. He was in the spotlight again this month when the TV broadcast of a San Francisco Giants game [showed](https://archive.is/o/fQAxq/https:/x.com/AlexFast8/status/1908700035887382702?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw|twcamp%5etweetembed|twterm%5e1908700035887382702|twgr%5ebd1fd790255343da1d0e1240b11e23a48d0966d3|twcon%5es1_&ref_url=https://www.si.com/fannation/mlb/fastball/news/massive-therapy-rabbit-alex-the-great-at-san-francisco-giants-seattle-mariners-game-goes-viral-01jr4frktpgx) Alex\u2019s large fuzzy frame and pointy ears in the crowd. He was wearing a baseball hat. Fans lost it.\n\n>\u201cThere\u2019s just not a place that he\u2019s not completely the center of attention,\u201d Josh Row, Alex\u2019s owner, told The Washington Post.\n\n>Row, 45, adopted the Flemish Giant bunny with light orange fur in December 2020 after his previous pet, a Lionhead rabbit named Sam, died of heart failure. Row said he wanted to save Alex, who was born at a farm in Modesto, California, that slaughtered rabbits for their meat.\n\n>In January 2021, Row brought Alex to visit a friend in Las Vegas. While many rabbits are scared of unfamiliar sounds and smells, Alex appeared to enjoy hopping around the Las Vegas Strip on a leash and watching water shows at the Fountains of Bellagio.Row said he soon added \u201cThe Great\u201d to Alex\u2019s name because he had a big presence wherever he went \u2014 and he thought it would be funny to name him after Alexander the Great, the king of an ancient Greek kingdom who created one of the largest empires in history.\n\n>At one of Alex\u2019s first checkups, a veterinarian told Row that Alex\u2019s outgoing nature would make him a good therapy animal, Row said. Alex began training in February 2021 through San Francisco\u2019s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He later earned his certificate after staying composed during tests in which officials pulled his legs, tail and mouth.\n\nThis bunny gets around.\n\nA video story about Alex:\n\n[Popular Bay Area rabbit Alex the Great helping bring smiles to residents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2QHQyCzPIM)",

Health Minister Akmaral Alnazarova announced that local and regional budgets will assume responsibility for insurance contributions on their behalf.\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s current health insurance model requires employed citizens to contribute 2% of their monthly salary, capped at 17,000 KZT (approximately $33), to the Fund for Social Medical Insurance (FSMI). Employers pay an additional 3% of each employee\u2019s salary, while individual entrepreneurs contribute 5% of their income. However, unemployed citizens, even if officially registered, are presently excluded from the system.\n\nIn response to a directive issued by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in February 2024, the Ministry of Health has drafted legislation that would enable local governments to make insurance payments for unemployed and vulnerable groups. The bill was submitted to the Mazhilis, the lower house of parliament, for consideration.\n\n\u201cThis is a step towards improving people\u2019s health and quality of life,\u201d Alnazarova said. \u201cLocal budgets will cover the contributions, and these individuals will receive insured status on a monthly basis, regardless of income.\u201d The change is expected to extend coverage to over one million additional citizens, granting them access to scheduled medical care.",
            "Damn, this is incredible news for the people of Kazakhstan! This is also sad news for the U.S. where it seems that even employer provided health insurance might become a thing of the past.",

It took a while, granted. I think everyone was stunned at the speed and scope at which he attempted to dismantle the federal government. But now that the judiciary, at all levels, has had time to consider what is happening, it's responding, in force.\n\nOne possible good thing that may result from theost disastrous Presidency in history will be a clarification on the form checks and balances the judiciary can exercise, even when the Legislative branch is paralyzed by fear and corruption.",

            "This is all part of a preplanned assault on U.S. democracy.\n\nFascists have been trying to take over the U.S. almost since the inception of Fascism.\n\nIn 1933 Fascists plotted to overthrow the U.S. government and replace the President with a Dictator.  [The Business Plot (1933)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot)\n\n>\"When and if fascism comes to America it will not be labeled 'made in Germany'; it will not be marked with a swastika; it will not even be called fascism; it will be called, of course, 'Americanism.'\" - Halford E. Luccock (1938)\n\n>The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.\n\n>The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.\n\n>They cultivate hate and distrust [of allies]. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. - Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944.\n\n[Don't Be A Sucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGAqYNFQdZ4)\n\n[Learn to recognize Fascism when you see it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ijn247/how_worried_are_you_about_the_rise_of_fascism/mbflw6n/?context=3)",

An emblematic case was that of the orangutan Sandra, who now lives at the Great Ape Center in Wauchula, Florida, where she has adapted and has friends of her own species.\n\n\nShe spent almost her entire life in poor conditions, but at least something is being done for Pupy now.

        "body": "Unlike painters and sculptors who never confuse their marble and pigment for the world itself, our ability to build richly detailed digital simulations has led some to treat these virtual constructs as the ultimate reality and future. This shift in perception\u00a0**reflects an egocentric projection\u2014the assumption that our creations mirror the very essence of nature itself**\u2014and it fuels the popular notion of a technological singularity, a point at which artificial intelligence will eclipse human intellect and unleash unprecedented change. Yet while human technological progress can race along an exponential curve, natural evolutionary processes unfold under utterly different principles and timescales. Conflating the two is a flawed analogy: digital acceleration is the product of deliberate, cumulative invention, whereas biological evolution is shaped by contingency, selection, and constraint. Assuming that technological growth must therefore culminate in a singularity overlooks both the distinctive mechanics of human innovation and the fundamentally non-exponential character of natural evolution.\n\nConsider autonomous driving as a concrete case study. In 2015 it looked as if ever-cheaper GPUs and bigger neural networks would give us fully self-driving taxis within a few years. Yet a decade\u2014and trillions of training miles\u2014later, the best systems still stumble on construction zones, unusual weather, or a hand-signal from a traffic cop. Why? Because \u201cdriving\u201d is really a tangle of sub-problems: long-tail perception, causal reasoning, social negotiation, moral judgment, fail-safe actuation, legal accountability, and real-time energy management. Artificial super-intelligence (ASI) would have to crack thousands of such multidimensional knots\u00a0**simultaneously**\u00a0across every domain of human life. The hardware scaling curves that powered language models don\u2019t automatically solve robotic dexterity, lifelong memory, value alignment, or the thermodynamic costs of inference; each layer demands new theory, materials, and engineering breakthroughs that are far from inevitable.\n\nNow pivot to the idea of merging humans and machines. A cortical implant that lets you type with your thoughts is an\u00a0*optimization*\u2014a speed boost along one cognitive axis\u2014not a wholesale upgrade of the body-brain system that evolution has iterated for hundreds of millions of years. Because evolution continually explores countless genetic variations in parallel, it will keep producing novel biological solutions (e.g., enhanced immune responses, metabolic refinements) that aren\u2019t captured by a single silicon add-on. Unless future neuro-tech can re-engineer the full spectrum of human physiology, psychology, and development\u2014a challenge orders of magnitude more complex than adding transistors\u2014our species will remain on a largely separate, organic trajectory. In short, even sustained exponential gains in specific technologies don\u2019t guarantee a clean convergence toward either simple ASI dominance or seamless human-computer fusion; the path is gated by a mosaic of stubborn, interlocking puzzles rather than a single, predictable curve.\n\n",

Building more lines is not only expensive, but very time consuming to acquire prosperities, legal challenges, and construction. While a generator seeking to go online often will pay to build a line (if there isn't an existing one already) to the grid, that doesn't cover the cost of other interconnections that will often be needed to move power around to maintain stability.\n\nNot insurmountable issues, but need to be accounted for.

I'm another inmate in the prison that is my mom's body and mind. My parents gave me everything and my biggest regret is having so little to offer in return at the end of their lives.

In this context, he emphasised the importance of cooperation with neighbouring countries.__\n\n>The Trias troop trial with Swiss, German and Austrian soldiers is necessary to improve the defence readiness of the respective armies, said Pfister in an interview with the Keystone-SDA news agency on Thursday at the training ground in Allentsteig, Austria. \u201cCooperation between the Swiss Armed Forces and their neighbours is of central importance,\u201d he stated.\n\n>The three countries benefit from each other\u2019s expertise, Pfister added. \u201cWe must be able to work together in the event of a conflict.\u201d\n\n>The Swiss Armed Forces cannot solve many issues autonomously. That is why it is important to practise interoperability.\n\n>__\u2018It is necessary to invest\u2019__\n\n>The fact that the first foreign trip of a new government minister is to Austria is a long-standing tradition, said Pfister. The exchange with Switzerland\u2019s neutral neighbour was also fitting in terms of content, as both countries were in the process of developing new security policy strategies.\n\n>Austrian Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner said that her country had just adopted the highest defence budget in history. \u201cIt is necessary to invest.\u201d\n\n>It is important for Switzerland and Austria to increasingly focus their armies on military national defence. \u201cIn order to be able to defend our common neutrality, it is also necessary to practise together,\u201d Tanner said.\n\n>__Exercise overshadowed by accident__\n\n>Since April 14 and until May 9, members of the Swiss Armed Forces have been training together with units from the Austrian and German armies at the Allentsteig military training area, around 100 kilometres north-west of Vienna. Around a thousand members of the Swiss Armed Forces are completing this refresher course abroad.\n\n>The exercise was overshadowed by an accident: during an exercise last Wednesday night, a Swiss soldier was run over by a military vehicle and seriously injured. Pfister wished the 19-year-old a speedy recovery. Such accidents must be avoided, he said. \u201cBut when so many people are training in such conditions, you can never completely rule it out.\u201d\n\n>According to the defence ministry, the young soldier will be brought to Switzerland as soon as his condition allows. The military tribunal, which is also on site at the foreign training centre, has begun an investigation."

This is not going to go anywhere, because people there are wild.

You\u2019re telling me these poor wittle maga people were so innocent and naive that they were coerced into voting for a guy who openly bragged about assaulting women, who led an attack on our capitol, who defies laws on the daily\u2026the list goes the fuck on. They didn\u2019t vote for him once, they voted for him twice. With a 4 year gap! All the virtue signaling can be set aside, there is zero sympathy for people who hear a man say vile things, votes for him, and then hits you with the surprise pikachu face when Dollar Store cranks up prices. Fuck. Them. All.",
            "This is just how you convert people and win. Yes, you don't understand or hate people who voted for Trump, you want to punish them and make them feel bad, and maybe that is the right thing to do, but its counterintuitive to winning."

            "As per [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-tariffs-gdp-polling) \ud83d\udcf0:\n\n- There is perhaps no one in the world better at stretching and bending the truth to fit his narrative than Donald Trump. This is the man, after all, whose first term in office gave us the phrase \u201calternative facts.\u201d\n\nBut lately, Trump\u2019s truth contortions have reached a breaking point, so much so that even he seems to struggle to keep his story straight.\n\nNowhere is this more obvious than on the issue of tariffs. During a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump had a mask-slip moment when he acknowledged that his trade war would likely increase product prices in the United States. \u201cMaybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSay what you want about Marie Antoinette, but at least \u201clet them eat cake\u201d was snappy.\n\nBut just as he appeared to be owning the impact tariffs will have in driving costs upward\u2014precisely the opposite of his Make America Affordable Again promise\u2014Trump tried to blame the flagging economic numbers on former President Joe Biden. \u201cThis is Biden\u2019s Stock Market, not Trump\u2019s,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nIt was the literal flip side of a January 2024 post in which Trump boasted, \u201cTHIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET,\u201d as the market soared to record highs under Biden. For those keeping track at home: This means it\u2019s the \u201cTrump stock market\u201d when Biden\u2019s president and the economy\u2019s growing and the \u201cBiden stock market\u201d when Trump\u2019s president and it\u2019s tanking. Still with us? Great.\n\nTrump\u2019s outburst on Wednesday came after the Commerce Department announced that the US GDP shrunk 0.3% during Trump\u2019s first three months in office. That dip, the Bureau of Economic Analysis wrote, \u201cprimarily reflected an increase in imports.\u201d In fact, the first quarter for 2025 saw the largest import surge since the pandemic, as companies scrambled to bring in foreign-made goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs set in. By contrast, during the last three months of Biden\u2019s presidency, GDP grew 2.4%.\n\nIn his post on Truth Social, Trump tried to claim that once tariffs are in place and companies bring manufacturing to the US, the state of the US economy will turn around. But economists, who predicted the situation would only get worse by the end of the year, aren\u2019t buying it.\n\nNeither, it turns out, are voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s doublespeak is so obvious that just 37% of US adults now approve of his handling of the economy, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. Trump has sought to shape this to fit his narrative of utter triumph too, writing on Truth Social this week, \u201cThe Polls from the Fake News are, like the News itself, FAKE! We are doing GREAT, better than ever before.\u201d\n\nIt is, frankly, getting a little desperate. Trump is losing his grip on the story he\u2019s always controlled best\u2014his own. His mixed messages on tariffs, contradictory economic claims, and increasingly obvious attempts to deflect blame have created narrative whiplash. This blatant mythmaking in the face of all evidence to the contrary is, of course, ripped from the authoritarian playbook. Is it any wonder that, according to one new poll, more than half of all Americans now view him as a \u201cdangerous dictator?\u201d",

Funnily enough, this includes a number of government officials and staffers working directly for the man who launched these massive new trade wars, all on the grounds of bad tariff math and the flimsy premise that he would bring economic \u201cliberation\u201d to America and make the country \u201cwealthy again.\u201d\n\nTwo Trump administration officials and a Trump aide tell Rolling Stone that they have done some stockpiling of their own in recent weeks or months, and that they know others working in Republican politics \u2014 inside and outside of the administration \u2014 who are doing the same. One of the Trump officials says they have already run to Target to bulk-buy toilet paper, some types of food, and other household supplies.\n\nRead more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-officials-hoarding-supplies-trade-war-tariffs-1235329235/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-officials-hoarding-supplies-trade-war-tariffs-1235329235/)",

So on Earth this is mainly created by life\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean it is on exoplanets, and in fact the lead authors explain this carefully. \n\nI think it\u2019s very important to remember that most scientific discoveries are not immediate slam dunks, but rather happen with intermediate steps. Think about water on Mars as an example- I remember when they first found proof that there might have been water on Mars but it wasn\u2019t conclusive, then they found better and more signatures, then evidence there used to be oceans\u2026 and today everyone agrees there\u2019s water on Mars.\n\nSimilarly, if looking for these signatures, the first are not conclusive because there are alternate possibilities still. But then you find a little more, and even more\u2026 and before you know it we all agree there\u2019s life elsewhere in the universe (though what puts it out there is far less clear).\n\nAs exciting as what Hollywood tells you it would be like?

            ">A 2-year-old boy who spent the night alone in the remote Arizona wilderness and walked 7 miles through mountain lion territory was led to safety by a rancher's dog, authorities said Tuesday.\n\n>A huge search operation was launched when the boy disappeared from his home in Seligman, Arizona, about 100 miles south of Grand Canyon National Park, at about 5 p.m. Monday. He was wearing just a blue tank top and pajama pants, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said.\n\n>The sheriff's office said that more than 40 rescuers, including Department of Public Safety rangers, joined the search, and a DPS helicopter spotted two mountain lions in the area.\n\n>But 16 hours after he went missing, rancher Scottie Dunton found him on his land 7 miles away. The boy was safe and well and had apparently been led to his property by the rancher's dog, Buford.\n\n>\"I got in my truck to go to town and I see Buford walking down the side of the fence with a little blond kid with him,\" Dunton told\u00a0NBC affiliate KPNX of Phoenix. \"I had heard about the missing child this morning, so I knew it was him.\"\n\n>Dunton asked the boy if he had walked all night, and he answered, \"No, I laid up under a tree. \"\n\n>The beef farmer said the boy was in good shape but upset. The rancher traced the boy's steps and found the dog had escorted him for at least a mile. He said Buford, an Anatolian Pyrenees, normally patrols his land and wards off coyotes.\n\n>He went through some rough country, it's all mountains and canyons and boulder piles, and it's rough for adults, let alone for 2-year-old kids,\" Dunton said. \"He did a remarkable job to go 7 miles like he did.\"\n\n>Dunton added that lions, coyotes, and the occasional bear can be found in the area. Dunton said of Buford, \"He loves kids, and I imagine he wouldn't leave him once he'd found him.\"\n\nWe've owned similar dogs in the past (Great Pyrenees rather than Anatolian ones) and they are such gentle giants. They are smart, great for herding and instinctively know what to do in a tough situation. Nice to see everything ended well.",

This attitude makes them perfect for their job of defending livestock when the farmer isn\u2019t there.
